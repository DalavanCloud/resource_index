We conducted an epidemiological study to determine the impact of some feto-maternal characteristics in the occurrence of NTD subtypes. Characteristics and outcomes of births with NTD and pregnancy characteristics of mothers over a period of twenty years (1991-2011) were recorded in the medical chart. From 1991 through 2011, 769 stillborns with NTD were delivered, yielding a prevalence of 2.02/10,000. The increase in NTD prevalences over these years was statistically significant (P=0.000). In addition, differences between prevalences of NTD subtypes over season (P=0.003) and between genders (P<0.001) were significant. The highest frequency was noticed in winter with 3, 7 per 10,000 births among females. The difference in fetal term between subtypes was significant (P=0.017). The probability to have a malformed fetus with a weight less than 1500g was three times higher in myelomeningocele than in craniorachischisis, two times higher in anencephaly and encephalocele, but two times lower than rachischisis. Mothers with one gestation were two fold higher in anencephaly than in encephalocele. Nulliparous mothers'' cases were significantly more likely to have NTD than uni- or multiparous mothers. O+ mother''s blood type presented a significant risk factor and was significantly less common in myelomeningocele than in rachischisis, but three times higher than in craniorachischisis. Consanguinity was present in cases with rachischisis and was two times higher than in cases with anencephaly, and three times higher than in cases with encephalocele. In this study, the results have been interpreted with caution due to analyses not being adjusted. One of the main findings of the study is that there are many differences between NTD subtypes, which suggests that there may be etiologic differences between subtypes. This suggests that, although epidemiologic studies frequently do not distinguish between NTD subtypes in analyses, they should be analyzed separately when possible.

It is well known that for dual-rail photons effective non-linearities and near-deterministic non-trivial two-qubit gates can be achieved via the measurement process and by introducing ancillary photons. While in principle this opens a legitimate path to scalable linear optical quantum computing, the technical requirements are still very challenging and thus other optical encodings are being actively investigated. One of the alternatives is to use single-rail encoded photons, where entangled states can be deterministically generated. Here we prove that even for such systems universal optical quantum computing using only passive optical elements such as beam splitters and phase shifters is not possible. This no-go theorem proves that photon bunching cannot be passively suppressed even when extra ancilla modes and arbitrary number of photons are used. Our result provides useful guidance for the design of optical quantum computers. ', '', ''

Here, we isolated ALAD1 cDNA from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its diploid progenitors, and produced transgenic tobacco plants expressing the wheat ALAD1 gene. The ALAD1 genes were highly conserved among wheat relatives, and three homoeologous loci of wheat ALAD1 (TaALAD1) were equally transcribed in common wheat. A transient expression assay of a TaALAD1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein suggested that TaALAD1 is localized in chloroplasts. Overexpression of TaALAD1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in a significant increase in ALAD activity in leaves. Moreover, the transgenic tobacco showed vigorous growth and increased survival rate on medium containing ALA at herbicidal concentrations. These results indicate that wheat ALAD1 has catalytic activity in metabolizing ALA in plastids, and that ectopic expression of TaALAD1 in transgenic plants increases their tolerance to ALA application at high concentrations.

From November 1971 to December 2005, 1,591 patients with primary transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder underwent RC, with an extended bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and urinary diversion. A positive STSM was defined as tumor identified at the inked perivesical soft tissue surrounding the cystectomy specimen. Data were analyzed according to various clinical and pathologic variables, and survival analysis was performed. A total of 18 patients (1%) demonstrated pathologic evidence of a positive STSM following RC. Positive STSM were significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion, advanced pathologic stage, lymph node involvement, extent of nodal involvement and lymph node density. No patient with an organ-confined primary bladder tumor had a positive STSM, while 3% with extravesical tumor extension demonstrated a positive STSM. Recurrence-free and overall survival at 5 and 10 years for patients with a positive STSM was 29 and 22%, and 29 and 11%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Only nine patients (1%) without evidence of nodal involvement had a positive STSM with a worse survival compared to those same pathologic subgroup and negative STSM. Nine patients (2%) with lymph node tumor involvement had positive STSM and also demonstrated significantly worse survival. Although a positive STSM was present in only 1% of patients undergoing a RC for TCC of the bladder, it was found to be an independent risk factor for advanced disease, lymph node involvement and tumor progression with worse survival.

Although respiratory symptoms can be suggestive of asthma, the diagnosis of asthma in elite athletes cannot be based solely on the presence or absence of symptoms; diagnosis should be based on objective measurements, such as the eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea test or exercise test. When considering that not all respiratory symptoms are due to asthma, other diagnoses should be considered. Certain regulations apply to elite athletes who require asthma medication for asthma. Knowledge of these regulations is essential when treating elite athletes. This article is aimed at physicians who diagnose and treat athletes with respiratory symptoms. It focuses on the pathogenesis of asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite athletes and how the diagnosis can be made. Furthermore, treatment of elite athletes with asthma, anti-doping regulations, and differential diagnoses such as exercise-induced laryngomalacia are discussed.

This study examined the developmental toxicity of p,p''-DDE via aqueous exposure to Antarctic krill larvae. p,p''-DDE exposure was found to stimulate developmental timing in the first three larval stages of Antarctic krill, while extended monitoring of larvae after a five day exposure period had ended, revealed delayed inhibitory responses during development to the fourth larval stage. Stimulatory responses were observed from the lowest p,p''-DDE body residue tested of 10.1±3.0 ?mol/kg (3.2±0.95 mg/kg) preserved wet weight, which is comparable to findings for temperate species and an order of magnitude lower than the exposure level found to cause sublethal behavioural effects in Antarctic krill. The delayed responses included increased mortality, which had doubled in the highest p,p''-DDE treatment (95±8.9% mortality at 20 ?g/L p,p''-DDE) compared to the solvent control (44±11% mortality) 2 weeks after end of exposure. Development of surviving metanauplius larvae to calyptopis 1 larvae was delayed by 2 days in p,p''-DDE exposed larvae compared with untreated larvae. Finally, the developmental success of surviving p,p''-DDE exposed larvae was reduced by 50 to 75% compared to the solvent control (100% developmental success). The lowest observed effect concentration for all delayed effects was 1 ?g/L, the lowest exposure concentration tested. These findings demonstrate the importance of delayed and indirect effects of toxicant exposure. Further, the findings of this study are important for environmental risk assessment of POPs in the Southern Ocean ecosystem and strongly highlight the significance of developmental endpoints for ecotoxicological testing.

The number of patient identification errors was greatly reduced by the system. However, identification errors have not been abolished in the ultrasound department. After re-evaluation of the patient identification process in this department, we recognized that the major reason for the errors came from excessive identification workflow. Ordinarily, an ultrasound test requires patient identification 3 times, because 3 different systems are required during the entire test process, i.e. ultrasound modality system, laboratory information system and a system for producing reports. We are trying to connect the 3 different systems to develop a one-time identification workflow, but it is not a simple task and has not been completed yet. Utilization of the laboratory information system is effective, but is not yet perfect for patient identification.

We used Rasch analysis and hypothesis testing with conventional statistical methodology to achieve three objectives: 1) to examine the items to identify the one characteristic that distinguishes one from another; 2) to asses these items for their ability to measure dyspnea severity in IPF; 3) to use the items to develop a dyspnea ruler. The sample comprised 178 subjects. The 21 items fit the Rasch model. There was very strong correlation between Rasch item severity and their metabolic equivalents (METS) values (r = -0.86, p < 0.0001).

In addition to contemporary epidemiological studies, systematic substantiation suggests that long-term diabetes leads to cancers due to a variety of reasons. In this study, blood samples were collected with informed consent from confirmed type I diabetic (T1DM, n=25) and type II Diabetic patients (T2DM, n=25) with equal numbers of controls. Further depending on the lifestyle habits they were subdivided into smokers/non-smokers and alcoholics/non-alcoholics. Chromosomal assays were performed for these cases and it was found that there was a significant increase in chromosomal aberration frequency in diabetic patient groups who are exposed to smoking and alcohol than that of normal diabetic groups (T1DM and T2DM). On the other hand, patient groups who were non-smoking and non-alcoholics also showed higher chromosomal aberrations when compared to that of controls. While the mechanisms for these increased chromosomal aberrations in diabetic groups are not clear, they may be due to increased oxidative stress leading to oxidative damage and resulting in genomic instability, which in turn may contribute to an increased risk for cancer.

The current study examines the role of the A622 gene from N. glauca (NgA622) in alkaloid production and utilises an RNAi approach to down-regulate gene expression and diminish levels of A622 protein in transgenic tissues. Results indicate that RNAi-mediated reduction in A622 transcript levels markedly reduces the capacity of N. glauca to produce anabasine resulting in plants with scarcely any pyridine alkaloids in leaf tissues, even after damage to apical tissues. In addition, analysis of hairy roots containing the NgA622-RNAi construct shows a substantial reduction in both anabasine and nicotine levels within these tissues, even if stimulated with methyl jasmonate, indicating a role for the A622 enzyme in the synthesis of both alkaloids in roots of N. glauca. Feeding of Nicotinic Acid (NA) to hairy roots of N. glauca containing the NgA622-RNAi construct did not restore capacity for synthesis of anabasine or nicotine. Moreover, treatment of these hairy root lines with NA did not lead to an increase in anatabine levels, unlike controls. Together, these results strongly suggest that A622 is an integral component of the final enzyme complex responsible for biosynthesis of all three pyridine alkaloids in Nicotiana.

In general, modelling of data has the purpose (1) to describe experimental data, (2a) to reduce the amount of data resulting from an experiment, e.g. a clinical trial and (2b) to obtain the most relevant parameters, (3) to test hypotheses and (4) to make predictions within the boundaries of experimental conditions, e.g. range of doses tested (interpolation) and out of the boundaries of the experimental conditions, e.g. to extrapolate from animal data to the situation in man. Describing the drug/xenobiotic-target interaction and the chain of biological events following the interaction is the first step to build a biologically based model. This is an approach to represent the underlying biological mechanisms in qualitative and also quantitative terms, thus being inherently connected in many aspects to systems biology. As the systems biology models may contain variables in the order of hundreds connected with differential equations, it is obvious that it is in most cases not possible to assign values to the variables resulting from experimental data. Reduction techniques may be used to create a manageable model which, however, captures the biologically meaningful events in qualitative and quantitative terms. Until now, some success has been obtained by applying empirical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models which describe direct and indirect relationships between the xenobiotic molecule and the effect, including tolerance. Some of the models may have physiological components built in the structure of the model and use parameter estimates from published data. In recent years, some progress toward semi-mechanistic models has been made, examples being chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and glucose-endogenous insulin-antidiabetic drug interactions. We see a way forward by employing approaches to bridge the gap between systems biology and physiologically based kinetic and dynamic models. To be useful for decision making, the ''bridging'' model should have a well founded mechanistic basis, but being reduced to the extent that its parameters can be deduced from experimental data, however capturing the biological/clinical essential details so that meaningful predictions and extrapolations can be made.

This study offers a review of eye anatomy in four groups of aquatic animals: cetaceans (toothed and baleen whales), pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses), sirenians (manatees and dugongs), and sea otters. Eye anatomy and optics, retinal laminar morphology, and topography of ganglion cell distribution are discussed with particular reference to aquatic specializations for underwater versus aerial vision. Aquatic mammals display emmetropia (i.e., refraction of light to focus on the retina) while submerged, and most have mechanisms to achieve emmetropia above water to counter the resulting aerial myopia. As underwater vision necessitates adjusting to wide variations in luminosity, iris muscle contractions create species-specific pupil shapes that regulate the amount of light entering the pupil and, in pinnipeds, work in conjunction with a reflective optic tapetum. The retina of aquatic mammals is similar to that of nocturnal terrestrial mammals in containing mainly rod photoreceptors and a minor number of cones (however, residual color vision may take place). A characteristic feature of the cetacean and pinniped retina is the large size of ganglion cells separated by wide intercellular spaces. Studies of topographic distribution of ganglion cells in the retina of cetaceans revealed two areas of ganglion cell concentration (the best-vision areas) located in the temporal and nasal quadrants; pinnipeds, sirenians, and sea otters have only one such area. In general, the visual system of marine mammals demonstrates a high degree of development and several specific features associated with adaptation for vision in both the aquatic and aerial environments.

In songbirds the site of this coordination is suspected to be the nucleus retroambigualis (RAm), because it contains premotor neurons projecting upon both vocal motoneurons and spinal motoneurons innervating expiratory muscles, and because it receives descending inputs from the telencephalic vocal control nucleus robustus archopallialis (RA). Here we used tract-tracing techniques to provide a more comprehensive account of the projections of RAm and to identify the different populations of RAm neurons. We found that RAm comprises diverse projection neuron types, including: 1) bulbospinal neurons that project, primarily contralaterally, upon expiratory motoneurons; 2) a separate group of neurons that project, primarily ipsilaterally, upon vocal motoneurons in the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nucleus (XIIts); 3) neurons that project throughout the ipsilateral and contralateral RAm; 4) another group that sends reciprocal, ascending projections to all the brainstem sources of afferents to RAm, namely, nucleus parambigualis, the ventrolateral nucleus of the rostral medulla, nucleus infra-olivarus superior, ventrolateral parabrachial nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus of the intercollicular complex; and 5) a group of relatively large neurons that project their axons into the vagus nerve. Three morphological classes of RAm cells were identified by intracellular labeling, the dendritic arbors of which were confined to RAm, as defined by the terminal field of RA axons.

Combining clinical risk factors, in addition to small changes in serum creatinine, has been proposed to improve the assessment of AKI. This notion was developed in order to identify the risk of AKI early in a patient''s clinical course. We set out to assess the performance of this combination approach. A secondary analysis of data from a prospective multicenter intensive care unit cohort study (September 2009 to April 2010) was performed. Patients at high risk using this combination approach were defined as an early increase in serum creatinine of 0.1-0.4 mg/dl, depending on number of clinical factors predisposing to AKI. AKI was defined and staged using the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. The primary outcome was evolution to severe AKI (Acute Kidney Injury Network stages 2 and 3) within 7 days in the intensive care unit. Of 506 patients, 214 (42.2%) patients had early creatinine elevation and were deemed at high risk for AKI. This group was more likely to subsequently develop the primary endpoint (16.4% versus 1.0% [not at high risk], P<0.001). The sensitivity of this grouping for severe AKI was 92%, the specificity was 62%, the positive predictive value was 16%, and the negative predictive value was 99%. After adjustment for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, serum creatinine, and hazard tier for AKI, early creatinine elevation remained an independent predictor for severe AKI (adjusted relative risk, 12.86; 95% confidence interval, 3.52 to 46.97). Addition of early creatinine elevation to the best clinical model improved prediction of the primary outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.75 to 0.83, P<0.001). Critically ill patients at high AKI risk, based on the combination of clinical factors and early creatinine elevation, are significantly more likely to develop severe AKI. As initially hypothesized, the high-risk combination group methodology can be used to identify patients at low risk for severe AKI in whom AKI biomarker testing may be expected to have low yield. The high risk combination group methodology could potentially allow clinicians to optimize biomarker use. ', '', ''

C. gigas larvae settled on SC of all species tested except on Patinopecten yessoensis and Atrina pinnata. In SC of species that induced C. gigas larvae to settle, settlement was proportionate to the amount of SC supplied to the larvae. When compared to C. gigas SC, all species except Crassostrea nippona showed lower settlement inducing activities, suggesting that the cue may be more abundant or in a more available form to the larvae in shells of conspecific and C. nippona than in other species. The settlement inducing activity of C. gigas SC remained intact after antibiotic treatment. Extraction of C. gigas SC with diethyl ether (Et2O-ex), ethanol (EtOH-ex), and water (Aq-ex) did not induce larval settlement of C. gigas larvae. However, extraction of C. gigas SC with 2N of hydrochloric acid (HCl-ex) induced larval settlement that was at the same level as the SC. The settlement inducing compound in the HCl-ex was stable at 100°C but was destroyed or degraded after pepsin, trypsin, PNGase F and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid treatments. This chemical cue eluted between the molecular mass range of 45 and 150 kDa after gel filtration and revealed a major band at 55 kDa on the SDS-PAGE gel after staining with Stains-all.

In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed using RD (embryonal) and RH30 (alveolar) cell lines to determine the efficacy of imatinib as single agent and in combination with topotecan (TPT). PDGFRbeta was significantly expressed in all cell lines, with the highest levels in RD, while PDGFR alpha and ABCG2 were significantly expressed only in RH30 and RMZ-RC2. c-Kit was not detected.

By combining scalar field topology and combinatorial connectivity techniques, we present a new framework, following a coarse to fine design philosophy, which allows for explicit control of the subjective quality criteria on the output quad mesh, at interactive rates. Our quadrangulation framework uses the new notion of Reeb atlas editing, to define with a small amount of interactions a coarse quadrangulation of the model, capturing the main features of the shape, with user prescribed extraordinary vertices and alignment. Fine grain tuning is easily achieved with the notion of connectivity texturing, which allows for additional extraordinary vertices specification and explicit feature alignment, to capture the high-frequency geometries.

We analyzed 675 consecutive hepatitis B and/or C related cirrhosis patients with ascites admitted in our hospital from November 2005 to December 2007. Of these, 187 patients had AFI; clinical and laboratory parameters of these patients including causes of cirrhosis, Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) score were recorded. Out of 187 patients with AFI, 44 (23.5%) had SBP while 143 (76.4%) had CNNA. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was the most common cause of cirrhosis in 139 (74.3%) patients. Patients with SBP had high CTP score as compared to CNNA (12.52 +/- 1.45 vs. 11.44 +/- 1.66); p < 0.001. Platelets count was low in patients with SBP (101 +/- 53 x 10(9)/L) as compared to CNNA (132 +/- 91 x 10(9)/L), p = 0.005. We found a high creatinine (mg/dl) (1.95 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.44 +/- 0.85), (p = 0.003) and high prothrombin time (PT) in seconds (24.8 +/- 6.6 vs. 22.4 +/- 7.2) (p = 0.04) in SBP as compared to CNNA.

A quantitative risk assessment.', 'Mouthwash ingestion has been observed in settings of restricted availability to alcoholic beverages such as in hospitals, prisons or military establishments. The literature offers limited evidence that ingredients of mouthwash may have health effects above the effects of ethanol. This study provides a quantitative risk assessment based on analysis of 30 mouthwash samples. All investigated brands contained alcohol, most of them menthol (93%), eucalyptol (90%), benzoic acid (87%), methyl salicylate (67%), and thymol (30%). For low risk drinking scenarios with average levels, only ethanol will exceed acceptable daily intakes (ADI). In worst case scenarios for alcohol dependent consumers ingesting 100g ethanol per day in the form of mouthwash, methyl salicylate will also exceeded the ADI by a factor of 17. The margin of exposure (MOE) for methyl salicylate, benzoates and thymol was below 100 for average scenarios, and below 10 for worst case scenarios, but ethanol is still the most toxic ingredient with MOE below 1. The occasional or even chronic ingestion of mouthwash may not cause health effects except the effects of ethanol alone. Only in extreme exposures, ingredients such as thymol or methyl salicylate could exacerbate the effects of ethanol, especially by contributing to metabolic acidosis.

However, its predictive role in disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) still remains inconclusive. The present study aimed to retrospectively investigate the association between AR and survival outcomes in breast cancer and also identify this association by a meta-analysis of published researches. Clinical data from 109 patients with breast cancer, who underwent surgery at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, were retrospectively analyzed for immunohistochemical AR expression measured by tissue microarray. For meta-analysis, articles available in Pubmed on the relationship between AR and breast cancer outcomes were included. Data obtained from both were combined and analyzed. Women with AR positive tumors in the retrospective study had a significantly better DFS (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.88) and OS (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.85) than women with AR negative ones. Meta-analysis showed that AR expression in breast tumors was an indicator of better DFS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.43-0.64). In subgroup analysis, AR could predict DFS outcome in estrogen receptor (ER) positive (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34-0.59), ER negative (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.67), and triple negative breast cancer (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23-0.69). Moreover, in ER positive breast cancer patients, the expression of AR could predict better OS (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.82). The present analysis indicated that AR expression was associated with lower risk of recurrence in patients with all breast cancer types and better OS in cases with ER positive.

As the number of such cells in adult tissue is low, an extremely efficient method is needed for their isolation. Here, we describe cell-separation methodologies based on magnetic-affinity cell sorting (MACS) MicroBeads with monoclonal antibodies against specific membrane proteins conjugated to superparamagnetic particles. Cells labeled with MACS MicroBeads are retained in a magnetic field within a MACS column placed in a MACS separator, allowing fast and efficient separation. Both positively labeled and non-labeled fractions can be used directly for downstream applications as the separated cell fractions remain viable with no functional impairment. As immunomagnetic separation depends on the interaction between a cell''s membrane and the magnetically labeled antibody, separation of specific cells originating from solid tissues is more complex and demands a cell-dissociating pretreatment. In this paper, we detail the use of immunomagnetic separation for the purpose of regenerating damaged salivary gland (SG) function in animal and human models of irradiated head and neck cancer. Each year 500,000 new cases of head and neck cancer occur worldwide. Most of these patients lose SG function following irradiation therapy. SGs contain integrin ?6?1-expressing epithelial stem cells.

The simultaneous strategies used in this study stimulated two or three electrodes simultaneously in a monopolar configuration and used a specific compensation algorithm to reduce detrimental effects of simultaneous channel interaction. Overall stimulation rate was kept constant throughout conditions. Three of the configurations applied extended pulse phase durations. The German Oldenburg sentence and a German vowel test were used to measure speech recognition in 12 cochlear implant users. The results support the initial hypothesis. No significant differences in performance were found. A small spatial distance between simultaneous electrodes yielded slightly better results than a large distance. Extending the pulse phase durations had no significant effect on hearing performance. However, it significantly reduced stimulation amplitudes. Thus strategies implementing channel interaction compensated simultaneous stimulation with extended pulse phase durations might be a viable option for reducing power consumption and increasing battery life in cochlear implants.

These strains grow on broth with the tetraacylated precursor lipid IV(A) replacing lipopolysaccharide [Meredith, T. C., et al. (2006) ACS Chem. Biol. 1, 33-42]. Deletion of kdtA, which encodes the Kdo transferase, is possible under these conditions. We now show that lipid IV(A) reaches the outer surface of the outer membrane in these strains, as judged by its accessibility to the lipase PagL. On the assumption that MsbA is optimized to transport penta- or hexaacylated lipid A, we overexpressed the lauroyl- or the myristoyltransferase of lipid A biosynthesis, encoded by lpxL and lpxM, respectively, and demonstrated that kdtA deletion mutants were also viable in this setting. Although E. coli LpxL is stimulated by the presence of the Kdo disaccharide in its acceptor substrate, LpxL does slowly acylate lipid IV(A). Overexpression of LpxL from a plasmid suppressed the lethality of kdtA deletions on nutrient broth at 30 or 37 degrees C without the need for MsbA overproduction. These strains accumulated penta- and hexaacylated free lipid A containing a secondary laurate chain or a laurate and a myristate chain, respectively. Deletion of kdtA in strains overexpressing LpxM accumulated pentaacylated lipid A with a secondary myristate moiety. None of the strains lacking kdtA grew in the presence of bile salts at any temperature or on nutrient broth at 42 degrees C. Our findings show that the main function of Kdo is to provide the right substrates for the acyltransferases LpxL and LpxM, resulting in the synthesis of penta- and hexaacylated lipid A, which is optimal for the MsbA flippase.

It has been more than 50 years since Moerch and Woltman reported the first 14 cases with this syndrome. During the last half century, many autoantibodies discovered, such as anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), anti-amphiphysin, anti-gephyrin, and anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) antibodies. There is strong evidence that in SPS, GABAergic neurotransmission is impaired by these pathogenic autoantibodies; however, the exact antigenic target remains unknown. This chapter focuses on the recent advances in the diagnosis, immunopathogenesis, and treatment of paraneoplastic SPS. Paraneoplastic SPS accounts for approximately 5% of all cases of SPS, and is associated with anti-amphiphysin, anti-gephyrin, and anti-Ri antibodies. In addition, author has reported cases of patients with SPS who were positive for anti-GAD antibodies and subsequently developed cancer. Because SPS often develops before the diagnosis of cancer, patients diagnosed with SPS should be monitored for the development of cancer. The treatment of SPS includes the administration of GABA enhancing and antispasmogenic drugs and immunomodulating therapies such as the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Treatments for cancer occasionally produce symptomatic improvement in patients with paraneoplastic SPS. Although the understanding and treatment of SPS have evolved, the disease remains underdiagnosed. In the past, some patients with SPS have been diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Therefore, it is important to increase awareness of SPS among practicing physicians.

Nevertheless, it remains a low priority for many health ministries. The most common form of SCD is caused by homozygosity for the ?-globin S gene mutation (SS disease). It is widely believed that this condition is associated with very high child mortality, but reliable contemporary data are lacking. We have reviewed available African data on mortality associated with SS disease from published and unpublished sources, with an emphasis on two types of studies: cross-sectional population surveys and cohort studies. We have concluded that, although current data are inadequate to support definitive statements, they are consistent with an early-life mortality of 50%-90% among children born in Africa with SS disease. Inclusion of SCD interventions in child survival policies and programs in Africa could benefit from more precise estimates of numbers of deaths among children with SCD. A simple, representative, and affordable approach to estimate SCD child mortality is to test blood specimens already collected through large population surveys targeting conditions such as HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, and covering children of varying ages. Thus, although there is enough evidence to justify investments in screening, prophylaxis, and treatment for African children with SCD, better data are needed to estimate the numbers of child deaths preventable by such interventions and their cost effectiveness.

Cigarette smoke (CS) has been shown to contribute to this process, the complex mechanism of which still needs to be unraveled. We developed an in vitro adhesion assay to investigate the CS-induced adhesion of monocytic MM6 cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following exposure to an aqueous CS extract (smoke-bubbled phosphate buffered saline: sbPBS), reasoning that in vivo monocytes and endothelial cells are exposed primarily to soluble constituents from inhaled CS absorbed through the lung alveolar wall. MM6 cell adhesion was increased exclusively by the conditioned medium from sbPBS-exposed MM6 cells, not by direct sbPBS exposure of the HUVECs within a range of sbPBS doses. Using a transcriptomics approach followed by confirmation experiments, we identified different exposure effects on both cell types and a key mechanism by which sbPBS promoted the adhesion of MM6 cells to HUVECs. While sbPBS provoked a strong oxidative stress response in both cell types, the expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, responsible for the adhesion of MM6 cells to HUVECs, was induced in the latter through a proinflammatory paracrine effect. We confirmed that this effect was driven mainly by TNF? produced by MM6 cells exposed to sbPBS. In conclusion, we have elucidated an indirect mechanism by which sbPBS increases the adhesion of monocytic cells to endothelial cells in this in vitro assay that was designed for tobacco product risk assessment while mimicking the in vivo exposure conditions as closely as possible.

Microarray, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting showed how RA regulated the ECM genes. RA (10(-5) M) significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited PVR membrane and traction retinal detachment formation (80%). Moreover, RA treatment significantly inhibited the migration (80%) and invasion (65%) behaviors of human RPE cells (P < 0.05) by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays, respectively. Microarray and q PCR analysis showed RA treatment did inhibit the motility of human RPE cells by inhibition of metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 2, 9, fibronectin-1, transforming growth factor beta, thrombospondin-1, tenascin C, most collagen, integrin, laminin molecules and along enhancing E-cadherin and MMP3 genes expression.

Spectroscopic analyses indicated that the concentrations of aromatic C and O-containing functional groups decreased with a progressive extraction as follows: F1>F2>F3. Cr(VI) removal by HA proceeded slowly, but it was enhanced when light was applied due to the production of efficient reductants, such as superoxide radical and H(2)O(2), for Cr(VI). Higher aromatic- and O-containing F1 fraction exhibited a greater efficiency for Cr(VI) reduction (with a removal rate of ca. 2.89 mmol g(-1) HA under illumination for 3 h).

In particular, infection via axon terminals is relatively inefficient but is a powerful means of achieving infection of specific neuron types. Combining this with optogenetic approaches requires high gene expression levels that are not typically achieved with nontoxic retrogradely infecting vectors. We generated rabies glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that use a positive feedback loop composed of a Tet promoter driving both its own tetracycline-dependent transcription activator (tTA) (\"TLoop\") and channelrhodopsin-2-YFP (ChR2YFP). We show that TLoop vectors strongly express proteins in a drug-controllable manner in neurons that project to injection sites within the mouse brain. After initial infection, the virus travels retrogradely, stably integrates into the host genome, and expresses gene products. The expression is robust and allows optogenetic studies of neurons projecting to the location of virus injection, as demonstrated by fluorescence-targeted intracellular recordings. ChR2YFP expression did not cause observable signs of toxicity and continued for up to 6 mo after infection. Expression can be reversibly blocked by administration of doxycycline, if necessary, for expression of gene products that might be more toxic. Overall, we present a system that will allow researchers to achieve high levels of gene expression even in the face of inefficient viral transduction.

Ethanol exposure disrupts SIRT1 activity and contributes to alcoholic liver disease in rodents, but the exact pathogenic mechanism is not clear. We compared mice with liver-specific deletion of Sirt1 (Sirt1LKO) mice with their LOX littermates (controls). We induced alcoholic liver injury in male Sirt1LKO and control mice, placing them on Lieber-DeCarli ethanol-containing diets for 10 days and then administering a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) via gavage. Liver and serum samples were collected. We also measured messenger RNA levels of SIRT1, SFRS10, and lipin-1? and lipin-1? in liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis and individuals without alcoholic hepatitis (controls). On the ethanol-containing diet, livers of Sirt1LKO mice accumulated larger amounts of hepatic lipid and expressed higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than control mice; serum of Sirt1LKO mice had increased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Hepatic deletion of SIRT1 exacerbated ethanol-mediated defects in lipid metabolism, mainly by altering the function of lipin-1, a transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. In cultured mouse AML-12 hepatocytes, transgenic expression of SIRT1 prevented fat accumulation in response to ethanol exposure, largely by reversing the aberrations in lipin-1 signaling induced by ethanol. Liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis had reduced levels of SIRT1 and a higher ratio of Lpin1?/? messenger RNAs than controls. In mice, hepatic deletion of Sirt1 promotes steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in response to ethanol challenge.

Undersampling allows more slices to be fit into a given temporal resolution.

In the first months of life, a period of greater neuronal plasticity, important changes are observed in the absolute latency and inter-peak intervals of BAEP, which occur up to the completion of the maturational process, around 18 months of life in full-term newborns, when the response is similar to that of adults. The goal of this study was to establish normal values of absolute latencies for waves I, III and V and inter-peak intervals I-III, III-V and I-V of the BAEP performed in full-term infants attending the Infant Hearing Health Program of the Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Course at Bauru School of Dentistry, Brazil, with no risk history for hearing impairment. The stimulation parameters were: rarefaction click stimulus presented by the 3ª insertion phone, intensity of 80 dBnHL and a rate of 21.1 c/s, band-pass filter of 30 and 3,000 Hz and average of 2,000 stimuli. A sample of 86 infants was first divided according to their gestational age in preterm (n=12) and full-term (n=74), and then according to their chronological age in three periods: P1: 0 to 29 days (n=46), P2: 30 days to 5 months 29 days (n=28) and P3: above 6 months (n= 12). The absolute latency of wave I was similar to that of adults, generally in the 1st month of life, demonstrating a complete process maturity of the auditory nerve. For waves III and V, there was a gradual decrease of absolute latencies with age, characterizing the maturation of axons and synaptic mechanisms in the brainstem level. Age proved to be a determining factor in the absolute latency of the BAEP components, especially those generated in the brainstem, in the first year of life.

This has been possible due to high use of fertilizers, good quality seeds and increased use of water resources. This increased demand of water resources has resulted in extensive use of groundwater in the central districts of the state and surface water (canals) in South-West Punjab, where groundwater is of poor quality in general. The state has been facing the twin problem of water table decline/rise in different parts. Efficient management relies on comprehensive database and regular monitoring of the resources. GIS is one of the important tools for integrating and analyzing spatial information from different sources or disciplines. It helps to integrate, analyze and represent spatial information and database of any resource, which could be easily used for planning of resource development, environmental protection and scientific researches and investigations. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have been used for a variety of groundwater studies. Groundwater level change maps are useful in determining areas of greatest changes in storage in the regional systems. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the long term groundwater behaviour of the state using GIS to visually and spatially analyze water level data obtained from the state and central agencies. The data was analysed for 0-3 m, 3-10 m, 10-20 m and beyond 20 m.

Magnesium influx was higher in low-magnesium cells compared to control or high-magnesium cells, whereas magnesium efflux was higher in high-magnesium cells compared to control and low-magnesium cells. Magnesium efflux was partially inhibited by imipramine, inhibitor of the Na(+)/Mg(2+) exchange. Using a monoclonal antibody detecting a approximately 70 kDa protein associated with Na(+)/Mg(2+) exchange activity, we found that the expression levels of this protein were proportional to magnesium efflux capacity, that is, high-magnesium cells > control cells > low-magnesium cells. As for magnesium influx, this was abolished by Co(III)hexaammine, inhibitor of magnesium channels. Surprisingly, we found that cells grown in low magnesium upregulated mRNA for the magnesium channel TRPM6, but not for other channels like TRPM7 or MagT1. TRPM6 mRNA was also rapidly upregulated or downregulated in HC11 cells deprived of magnesium or in low-magnesium cells re-added with magnesium, respectively. TRPM6 protein levels, as assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence, underwent similar changes under comparable conditions. We propose that mammary epithelial cells adapt to decreased magnesium availability by upregulating magnesium influx via TRPM6, and counteract increased magnesium availability by increasing magnesium efflux primarily via Na(+)/Mg(2+) exchange. These results show, for the first time, that TRPM6 contributes to regulating magnesium influx in mammary epithelial cells, similar to what is known for intestine and kidney.

However, the mean quantity of the fish consumed by the fathers was 2.5 and 2.4 times higher than those of the mothers and children, implying that there was a wide variation in hair Hg concentrations between the fathers and the mothers and children of the same household, which was probably related to the quantity, frequency and type of fish consumed.

Chimpanzee unit groups (or communities) show fission-fusion grouping patterns and form temporal parties. Fruit availability is assumed to be one of the important limiting factors in relation to the size of these parties. Different methods have been proposed to measure party size, but they all appear to focus mainly on two aspects of grouping phenomena. In \"face-to-face parties\", party size is measured by scan sampling, whereas in \"nomadic parties\", all members observed during a specific time period are counted. The mean monthly group size resulting from these two measures was compared with fruit availability, i.e. fruiting plant density and mean potential patch size. Nomadic party size was correlated with both values. Thus, party formation at this level was considered to be sensitive to overall fruit availability in the habitat. On the other hand, face-to-face party size remained stable and showed weak or no correlations with density and potential patch size. Although large patches are available during the peak fruiting season, Mahale chimpanzees depend on the liana species Saba comorensis, which, when fruiting, encourages individuals to spread out to eat. Thus, the lack of correlation between face-to-face-party size and fruit availability was attributed to the influence of physical limitations countervailing the fluctuation in fruit availability. Maximum face-to-face party size relative to unit-group size, regarded as the cohesiveness of a unit group, was compared among sites. The values differed largely: Mahale groups M and K, Bossou, and, in some years, Budongo, showed high cohesiveness, while others remained low. Thus, the distribution of the most important food during the fruiting season in each study site may be a crucial factor in the grouping phenomena of chimpanzees.

Anti-CD45RB mediates allograft tolerance in mice by inducing CTLA-4 expression on CD4 cells, providing a novel opportunity to determine how therapeutic enhancement of CTLA-4 promotes tolerance. We now show that induced CTLA-4 expression normally resolves by day 17. Although thymectomy prolongs enhanced CTLA-4 expression, long-term engraftment is unaffected. To address the temporal relationship between increased CTLA-4 expression and engraftment, transplantation was delayed for various times after anti-CD45RB treatment. Delaying transplantation for 7 days (when CTLA-4 expression had peaked but treatment mAb was no longer detectable), resulted in long-term engraftment comparable to transplantation with no delay (day 0). Delaying transplantation from 10 to 18 days led to a progressively poorer outcome as CTLA-4 expression returned to baseline. This suggested that Ag exposure while CTLA-4 expression is enhanced is sufficient to induce long-term engraftment. To substantiate this, on day 0, anti-CD45RB-treated mice received BALB/c vs unrelated alloantigen, followed by transplantation of BALB/c islets 10 days later. Whereas recipients exposed to unrelated Ag experienced acute rejection, recipients exposed to donor Ag achieved long-term engraftment. Anti-CD45RB-treated mice exposed to alloantigen exhibited anergic CD4(+)CD25(-) effector cells and regulatory CD4(+)CD25(+) cells. Moreover, CD25 depletion in the peritransplant period prevented anti-CD45RB-mediated engraftment. Thus, exposure of CD4 cells expressing CTLA-4 to donor Ag is necessary and sufficient to induce long-term engraftment which appears to be mediated by both regulation and anergy.

A positive answer was suggested by a report that placed the estimate of hereditary disease in apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma as high as 24%. We applied clinically useful criteria to a review of the literature, defining cases of apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma as those without a suspicious personal or family history, with a focal, unilateral pheochromocytoma, and presenting at age less than 50 yr.

When the KCl electrode was placed on the atrium during AV block, remote atrial monophasic components were completely dissociated from local, ventricular deflections. At left ventricular sites with a positive T wave, the Laplacian signal showed that the end of the T wave was caused by remote repolarization. During cooling-induced regional action potential prolongation, the T wave became negative, whereby the positive flank of the T wave remained correlated with repolarization (recorded with a MAP at the same site).

An understanding of how calorie restriction works may lead to novel drugs to combat diseases of aging.

Few studies on the expression of p16 and retinoblastoma proteins in oral cavity squamous carcinomas have been conducted. To correlate the expression of p16 and retinoblastoma proteins to clinicopathological characteristics in these tumours. 45 patients with resected oral cavity squamous carcinoma were selected, for whom this was the initial treatment and who were followed up for 5 years or until death. Immunohistochemical stains with antibodies to the Rb and p16 gene products were carried out on paraffin wax-embedded tissue. Data on clinicopathological features such as tumour differentiation, nodal status, stage and survival outcome were collected. Retinoblastoma expression was seen in 39 of 45 (87%) patients and p16 expression in 6 of 45 (13%) patients. A significant inverse correlation was observed between retinoblastoma and p16 expression as nearly all retinoblastoma negative cases were p16 positive, and vice versa. When examined for clinicopathological correlates, it was found that all 39 tumours that expressed retinoblastoma displayed marked keratinisation and were of low-moderate histological grade. Conversely, five of the six tumours that expressed p16 were found to be poorly differentiated, with minimal keratin expression. Salient relationships were seen between expression of retinoblastoma and p16 and keratinisation. A marked loss of keratin production was evident in the tumours that expressed p16. Tumours expressing retinoblastoma were seen to exhibit more widespread keratinisation. In addition, an inverse staining pattern was found for retinoblastoma and p16 as retinoblastoma-expressing tumours were nearly universally p16 negative and vice versa. No correlation of expression of either p16 or retinoblastoma was found with survival or stage. A link between the histologically observable morphology and expression of cell cycle regulatory protein with the expression of p16 and retinoblastoma has been suggested with keratinisation and differentiation of status.

Since the changes in the seedlings elicited by exposure to mimosine were similar to those effected by Se at an optimal exposure level of 0.75 ppm (Sreekala et al., Biol Trace Elem Res 70:193-207, 1999), the uptake of Se and that of mimosine itself was individually studied in the respiring mitochondria of Se-deficient seedlings (-Se-stressed group) in comparison with those exposed to mimosine during growth at 0.1 mM (Mim 0.1 group). In both groups, the mitochondrial uptake of (75)Se at 10 microM added Na(2)(75)SeO(3), increased linearly up to 2 min, attaining steady-state levels thereafter. Uptake levels were 2.3-fold higher in the Mim 0.1 group than in the -Se-stressed group. Double-reciprocal plots of mitochondrial (75)Se uptake against 2-20 microM Na(2)(75)SeO(3) in the medium were nonlinear and negative cooperative effects during the uptake were confirmed by Scatchard plots, whereas Hill coefficients were 0.8 and 0.85 for the two groups. Mitochondrial uptake of mimosine, at added levels of 25 or 50 microM, increased linearly up to 1 min and decelerated thereafter. Initial uptake levels of mimosine at 1 min were higher by 6.5-fold at 25 microM and 4-fold at 50 microM in the Mim 0.1 group than those in the -Se-stressed group. Initial uptake levels with added mimosine up to 50 or 100 microM yielded nonlinear double-reciprocal plots; and kinetic analyses at 5 to 50 microM revealed the prevalence of positive cooperativity in the -Se-stressed group and negative cooperativity in the Mim 0.1 group. Involvement of active thiol groups in the uptake of both Se and mimosine were indicated by inhibition studies. Evidence presented for mimosine mediated increase in mitochondrial Se uptake and cooperative interactions thereof underscores the metabolic significance of mimosine.

Hypoxia is a potent stimulator of VEGF expression, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is considered to be critical for this induction. However, we have previously demonstrated that induction of VEGF by hypoxia was preserved when HIF-1alpha was silenced. We sought to better define the molecular basis of this HIF-1-independent regulation. In colon cancer cells, hypoxia stimulated multiple K-ras effector pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. VEGF promoter deletion studies identified a novel promoter region between -418 and -223 bp that was responsive to hypoxia in a PI3K/Rho/ROCK-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a fragment between -300 and -251 bp that demonstrated a unique shift only in hypoxic conditions. Inhibition of PI3K or ROCK blocked the formation of this complex. A binding site for c-Myc, a target of ROCK, was identified at -271 bp. A role for c-Myc in the hypoxic induction of VEGF was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of the VEGF promoter and silencing of c-Myc by small interfering RNA. Collectively, these findings suggest an alternative mechanism for the hypoxic induction of VEGF in colon cancer that does not depend upon HIF-1alpha but instead requires the activation of PI3K/Rho/ROCK and c-Myc.

We concomitantly localized two important phagocytosis-related enzymes, acid phosphatase (ACP) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), in Hofbauer cells in second trimester placental villi, and compared them with those from infection-related second trimester-spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) placentas. There were two types of Hofbauer cells. The first cells exhibited ACP stainings confined to the lysosomes, suggesting that they are dormant/non-activated cells. Approximately two-thirds of these cells showed weak G6PD labeling on the cytosolic side of endoplasmic reticula, and G6PD labeling was hardly recognizable in the remaining one-third. The second cells, possessing large phagosomes, showed marked ACP labeling in the phagosomes, suggesting that they are activated/phagocytosing cells.

For its various roles, Kar3 forms a heterodimer with either Cik1 or Vik1, both of which are noncatalytic polypeptides. Here, we present the first biochemical characterization of Kar3Cik1, the kinesin motor that is essential for karyogamy. Kar3Cik1 depolymerizes microtubules from the plus end and promotes robust minus-end-directed microtubule gliding. Immunolocalization studies show that Kar3Cik1 binds preferentially to one end of the microtubule, whereas the Kar3 motor domain, in the absence of Cik1, exhibits significantly higher microtubule lattice binding. Kar3Cik1-promoted microtubule depolymerization requires ATP turnover, and the kinetics fit a single exponential function. The disassembly mechanism is not microtubule catastrophe like that induced by the MCAK Kinesin-13s. Soluble tubulin does not activate the ATPase activity of Kar3Cik1, and there is no evidence of Kar3Cik1(.)tubulin complex formation as observed for MCAK. These results reveal a novel mechanism to regulate microtubule depolymerization. We propose that Cik1 targets Kar3 to the microtubule plus end. Kar3Cik1 then uses its minus-end-directed force to depolymerize microtubules from the plus end, with each tubulin-subunit release event tightly coupled to one ATP turnover.

It is not known whether this descending projection is prevalently excitatory or inhibitory. Using the neuronal tracer Wheat Germ Agglutinin conjugated to Horse Radish Peroxidase (WGA-HRP) the connections between the inferior colliculus and the DCN of the rat have been investigated. By far most retrograde labelled large neurons were glycine and GABA negative (pyramidal and giant neurons) and rare medium-size cells were glycine positive. The ultrastructural immunocytochemical analysis for glycine and GABA shows that mainly large, excitatory, neurons innervate the inferior colliculus. Rare medium-size glycine-positive cells with intermediate characteristics between pyramidal and cartwheel cells, seem also to project to the colliculus. Few WGA-HRP labelled boutons contact the large cells or their dendrites, have symmetric pre- and post-synaptic thickenings, contain pleomorphic and/or flat vesicles, and are labelled for GABA or glycine. Since no GABA labelled cells in both the dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus were retrograde labelled from the colliculus, the source of these intrinsic anterograde labelled boutons must be external to the cochlear nucleus. GABA positive neurons are both present in the inferior colliculus (injected with the tracer) and superior olivary complex (not injected with the tracer). This suggests that the double labelled boutons (WGA-HRP and GABA) are inhibitory GABA-ergic collicular terminals contacting the excitatory neurons of the DCN. Other few boutons or mossy fibers containing round vesicles and immunonegative for both glycine and GABA, were also seen contacting the large neurons and their dendrites in the DCN. As the round vesicles boutons may be derived from other retrograde cells of the cochlear nucleus (pyramidal and stellate cells) and those glycine positive from the glycinergic neurons in paraolivary nuclei, it is more likely that only the WGA-HRP and GABA labelled boutons are true collicular terminals.

We have mapped multiprotein complexes formed around the putative human Par orthologs MARK4 (microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4) (Par-1), Par-3, LKB1 (Par-4), 14-3-3zeta and eta (Par-5), Par-6a, -b, -c, and PKClambda (PKC3). We employed a proteomic approach comprising tandem affinity purification (TAP) of protein complexes from cultured cells and protein sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. From these data we constructed a highly interconnected protein network consisting of three core complex \"modules\" formed around MARK4 (Par-1), Par-3.Par-6, and LKB1 (Par-4). The network confirms most previously reported interactions. In addition we identified more than 50 novel interactors, some of which, like the 14-3-3 phospho-protein scaffolds, occur in more than one distinct complex. We demonstrate that the complex formation between LKB1.Par-4, PAPK, and Mo25 results in the translocation of LKB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and to tight junctions and show that the LKB1 complex may activate MARKs, which are known to introduce 14-3-3 binding sites into several substrates.

The slits in the grating are subwavelength which can nevertheless allow significant transmission in the narrow wavelength regions where the so-called surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and waveguide mode resonances occur. The solution is obtained for each spectral component of the pulse by using the rigorous coupled wave approach and then the temporally varying output pulse is reconstructed by the standard method of taking an inverse Fourier transform. The delay of the pulse and the output pulse widths are determined by taking the first and second order moments of the Poynting vector with respect to time. It is shown that the time delay may be significant, as much as 256 fs for a pulse width of 200 fs for the SPP resonance but quite small (32 fs) for the waveguide mode resonance. The focus of the work is on demonstrating how the pulse delay evolves as the pulse propagates in the half-space beyond the grating. It is shown that the distance over which the time delay develops is much larger than the actual longitudinal dimension of the grating structure and it is approximately the same distance over which the stored energy and the vortices of the Poynting vector extend.

The interterritorial matrix demonstrated elongated parallel ridges, whereas the pericellular matrix showed irregular, short-range elevations with characteristic pores and canals. Analysis of surface contours at 600nm(2) scan size revealed that the interterritorial matrix had significantly greater surface roughness (71+/-18nm; mean+/-SE) than the pericellular matrix (24+/-4nm) ( P< 0.001).

The electrostatic interactions play an important role in maintaining the stability and specificity of the Cyt b(5)-Cyt c complex that is formed. There is no essential effect on the intraprotein complex electron transfer even if most of the involved negatively charged residues on the surface of Cyt b(5) have been removed. The results support a dynamic docking paradigm for Cyt b(5)-Cyt c interactions. The orientation that is optimal for binding may not be optimal form for electron transfer. Substitution of hydrophobic residues does not have a significant effect on the binding between Cyt b(5) and Cyt c; rather, it regulates the electron transfer rates via changes in the driving force.

Two days post-operative, he developed a frontal headache and blurred vision in both eyes. Ophthalmic examination revealed right VIth cranial nerve palsy. Imaging studies indicated pituitary apoplexy with a large hypodense pituitary lesion with widening of the sella turcica. Laboratory findings included positive lupus anticoagulant, a normal prothrombin time (PT), and an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Five days after the initial symptoms, a transsphenoidal pituitary resection was performed. At a 6 months follow-up, the VIth nerve paresis was completely resolved.

In the ''top-down'' approach, biomaterials are generated by stripping down a complex entity into its component parts (for example, paring a virus particle down to its capsid to form a viral cage). This contrasts with the ''bottom-up'' approach, in which materials are assembled molecule by molecule (and in some cases even atom by atom) to produce novel supramolecular architectures. The latter approach is likely to become an integral part of nanomaterials manufacture and requires a deep understanding of individual molecular building blocks and their structures, assembly properties and dynamic behaviors. Two key elements in molecular fabrication are chemical complementarity and structural compatibility, both of which confer the weak and noncovalent interactions that bind building blocks together during self-assembly.

Maternally expressed DE-cad(ex) result in phenotype with variable expressivity. Most severely affected embryos have abnormalities in epithelialization of the blastoderm, resulting in loss of the blastodermal cells'' apico-basal polarity and monolayered structure. Another phenotypic class forms a rather normal blastoderm, but shows abnormalities in proliferation and morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and neurulation. Mitosis of the mesoderm occurs prematurely before invagination, and proliferation in the ectoderm, normally a highly ordered process, occurs in a random pattern. Mitotic spindles of ectodermal cells, normally aligned horizontally, frequently occurred vertically or at an oblique angle. This finding further supports recent findings indicating that, in the wild-type ectoderm, the zonula adherens is required for the horizontal orientation of mitotic spindles. Proliferation defects in DE-cad(ex)-expressing embryos are accompanied by the loss of epithelial structure of ectoderm and neuroectoderm. These germ layers form irregular double or triple layers of rounded cells that lack zonula adherens. In the multilayered neuroectoderm, epidermal precursors, neuroblasts and ganglion mother cells occurred intermingled, attesting to the pivotal role of DE-cadherin in delamination and polarized division of neuroblasts. By contrast, the overall number and spacing of neuroblasts was grossly normal, indicating that DE-cadherin-mediated adhesion is less important for cell-cell interaction controlling the ratio of epidermal vs. neural progenitors.

The objective in the study was to examine the impact of mastoidectomy on the repair of uncomplicated tympanic membrane perforations. Retrospective study of patients at tertiary referral center. Four hundred eighty-four patients who underwent surgical repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations were identified and reviewed in a retrospective manner. Simple tympanic membrane perforations were defined as tympanic membrane perforations of any size and location without any of the following confounding variables: 1). active infection (active otorrhea, abnormal middle ear mucosa, or granulations tissue); 2). ossicular abnormalities (ossicular fixation, ossicular discontinuity, ossicular malformation, or ossicular absence); 3). cholesteatoma; or 4). prior attempt at tympanic membrane repair (prior tympanoplasty or mastoidectomy). Surgical outcome and clinical course were assessed to compare results of tympanic membrane perforation repair with and without canal wall up mastoidectomy. Tympanic membrane repair was equally effective in both groups at 91%. Hearing results were comparable. Development of persistent ipsilateral otological disease requiring a subsequent ipsilateral procedure was approximately twice as common in the tympanoplasty group. In the tympanoplasty group, 14.1% of patients underwent subsequent ipsilateral otological procedures, and 6.1% of patients in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy intact canal wall group underwent subsequent ipsilateral procedures (P <.05). The most common subsequent ipsilateral procedures were tympanoplasty, tympanostomy tube placement, tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall up, and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall down, in that order. After including untreated tympanic membrane perforations as subsequent procedures, the adjusted rate of subsequent procedures was 15.5% in the tympanoplasty group and 12.2% in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy group (P >.05). Mastoidectomy was not necessary for successful repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations. However, mastoidectomy impacted the clinical course in patients by reducing the number of patients requiring future procedures and by decreasing disease progression. This suggests that even in the absence of active evidence of infection, mastoidectomy improved the underlying disease process. Combining mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty during repair of simple perforations in patients with no active evidence of infection remains an appropriate option and may be valuable in reducing the need for future surgery.

The quantitative results were compared with those of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in arterial territories with resting contractile dysfunction and correlated with the evolution of regional and global function at follow-up. At baseline, 25 arterial territories were analysed. Using sestamibi, on average one-third of their surface was considered to be normally perfused. No clear association was found between the percent normally perfused surface and the DSE findings. Adding BMIPP and using a value of > 7% of the arterial surface with BMIPP lower than sestamibi (mismatch) as the cut-off for the significance of viability, 14 of 18 mismatched regions were considered viable by DSE, and six of seven with < 7% mismatched surface or matching were not.

This effect is associated, among other functions, with the spleen''s capacity to filter and destroy erythrocytes parasitized by plasmodies or altered by various physical (heat...) or chemical factors. In addition, splenic immunity, which associates specific and nonspecific humoral and cellular effector mechanisms is no longer a question of debate. There remains nevertheless one aspect of the question to be elucidated: the probable interaction between this immunity and other (genetic...) factors of the malarious host. CELL FUNCTIONS: This article summarizes current knowledge in connection with: a) participation of various cell populations in the mechanisms of splenic filtration and phagocytosis and b) genesis of a repertory of B and T lymphocytes, plasmodio-specific memory cells. During an infection, lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages are recruited from peripheral blood and, in cooperation with cells known as \"barrier\" cells, increase the capacity of splenic filtration/purge and phagocytosis. In addition, the appearance of B and T lymphocytes with specific memory of P. falciparum result from hypermutation in VH genes (for B lymphocytes) or from clonal selection (for T lymphocytes). The folicular dendritic cells accomplish a reserve function. By constantly releasing the antigen, these cells would contribute to maintaining immune memory or to stimulating naive cells. Further studies are necessary to better understand the role of the splenic microcirculation and to identify parasite components which stimulate the protective response of the spleen against plasmodies.

In our study, sperm whales were almost always silent at the surface. They consistently started clicking within 25 s after fluking-up and diving. During the first 10 s of clicking, interclick intervals were significantly correlated with water depths at the location of fluke-up. The first \"creak\" was produced on average 7.5 min into a dive. Interclick intervals usually decreased substantially before clicks turned into \"creaks.\" The highest click rate recorded in this study was 90.9 click/s, and clicks-within-creaks were much shorter than \"usual clicks\" (mean of 3.6 ms versus 17 to 30 ms). The number of creaks per minute of dive and the length of a dive were significantly correlated. On average, sperm whales were silent for the last 3.6 min before surfacing. Short sequences of \"surface clicks\" (3 to 8 metallic clicks with mean interclick interval of 5.5 s) were often produced at the end of a dive (in 57% of the dives), but their function remains puzzling. The results of this study suggest that usual clicks and creaks are both used for echolocation purposes, the former to gather information about acoustically reflective features and the latter to detect prey.

When several MUs are activated together the response increases non-linearly with respect to tension. The dynamic response has been re-examined by recording the responses of TOs, in the adult cat, to tetanic, isometric contractions of one or more MUs and has been found to comprise two components: for each MU-TO pair the instantaneous frequency between the first two impulses of the response was linearly related to the rate of rise of the tension, the slope of the relationship being greatest for the slow units. Similarly, when activating MUs were stimulated together, the relationships between frequency and the initial rate of tension rise were linear. When the relationships were expressed in terms of relative tension rate the organs were found to be most strongly activated by the IIb muscle fibres, the responsiveness at the level of the whole muscle being reduced by unloading effects. The later component of the response showed an exponential relationship between discharge frequency and rate of tension development, the slope of the relationship between frequency and the logarithm of tension rate being independent of MU size. Although absolute tension increases during a contraction, this did not appear to impinge on the response which was dominated by the dynamic parameters of the contraction.

These parasites show considerable intra-species genetic diversity and variation, which complicates taxonomic classification and epidemiology. We have used the variability of the transcribed noncoding regions between the small and large subunit rRNA genes to examine relationships in this group. In a method termed intergenic region typing (IRT), PCR amplification products were obtained for the rapidly evolving 1-1.2-kb internal transcribed spacers (ITS) between the SSU and LSU rRNAs, from 50 parasites isolated from different hosts and geographic areas. Amplified DNAs were digested with 10 different enzymes, and fragment patterns compared after acrylamide gel electrophoresis. High levels of intra- and inter-specific variation were observed, and quantitative similarity comparisons were used to associate different lineages. A complex evolutionary tree was obtained. Some species formed tight clusters (L. equatorensis, L. panamensis, L. guyanensis, L. shawi), while L. braziliensis was highly polymorphic and L. naiffi showed intraspecific distances comparable to the largest obtained within all Viannia. L. colombiensis, L. equatorensis and L. lainsoni clearly represent distinct lineages. Good agreement was obtained with molecular trees based upon isoenzyme or mini-exon repeat sequence comparisons. Overall, IRT appears to be a superb method for epidemiological and taxonomic studies of Leishmania, being sensitive, rapid and quantitative while simultaneously revealing considerable molecular diversity.

In the Xenopus oocyte expression system rat eag mRNA gives rise to voltage activated K channels which have distinct properties in comparison with Drosophila eag channels and other voltage activated K channels. Thus, the rat eag channel further extends the known diversity of K channels. Most notably, the kinetics of rat eag channel activation depend strongly on holding membrane potential. Hyperpolarization slows down the kinetics of activation; conversely depolarization accelerates the kinetics of activation. This novel K channel property may have important implications in neural signal transduction allowing neurons to tune their repolarizing properties in response to membrane hyperpolarization.

The base is not distributed randomly in these genomes but conforms to a pattern. This pattern varies between taxa but appears to be inherited in a semi-conservative fashion. At the level of the genome, gross changes in the level of DNA methylation have been noted. This has encouraged speculation that the modification may play a role in cellular differentiation. Tissue-specific patterns of DNA methylation, predicted by various models of differentiation, have been found for most vertebrate genes so far examined. A correlation has emerged between the undermethylation of these regions and their transcription, but this is not always the case. While data for eukaryotic viral sequences are less equivocal, studies of this kind cannot in isolation distinguish between undermethylation being a cause or a consequence of gene activity. If it were a cause, it is probable that the demethylation of specific CpG sites would be a necessary yet not a sufficient condition for transcription to occur. The introduction of artificially methylated DNA sequences into individual eukaryotic cells by microinjection or transformation may provide the means to elucidate these questions in the future. In the meantime, the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation promises to contribute much to our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in these organisms.

For 9 days, TRH was administered intermittently at 0.33 or 3.3 micrograms/min for 6 of every 60 min and continuously at 0.33 micrograms/min. With both modes, the PRL levels and responsiveness to TRH simulation peaked on day 1 and then fell to levels that were still higher than the preinfusion values; levels for the intermittently treated group on days 3-9 were 2- to 4-fold above prestimulation levels and significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than levels for the continuously treated group. Elevated basal levels and PRL responses to TRH pulses were similar during the 0.33 and 3.3 micrograms/min pulses of the 9-day treatment period. For both TRH modes, TSH levels were elevated significantly (P less than 0.001) on day 1 [this increase was higher with continuous infusion (P less than 0.001)] and then fell to preinfusion levels by day 3. Serum T4 also increased during both continuous and intermittent TRH stimulations. However, serum T4 levels were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) after intermittent TRH (both 0.33 and 3.3 micrograms/min) than after continuous (0.33 micrograms) TRH (8 +/- 1.1 and 10 +/- 1.8 micrograms T4/dl vs. 18 +/- 3.1 micrograms, respectively). These PRL and T4 responses were replicated when the mode of administering 0.33 micrograms/min TRH was reversed after 9 days. An iv bolus of TRH (20 micrograms) after 9 days of continuous or intermittent TRH infusion caused significant release of PRL and TSH, an indication that neither mode of administration resulted in pituitary depletion of releasable hormone. We have concluded that intermittent TRH is more effective in elevating serum PRL, and continuous TRH is more effective in raising TSH and T4 levels. Thus, the manner of TRH secretion by the hypothalamus may determine its relative physiological importance in the stimulation of lactotropes and thyrotropes.

Increasing the K(+) supplied to the roots from 2 millimolarity, a level just sufficient to overcome obvious deficiency symptoms, to 10 millimolarity resulted in a gradual accumulation of K(+) per unit area and an increased export of K(+) to sink regions. No significant increase in net carbon exchange was observed in leaves that had accumulated a high level of K(+) per unit area. Initiation rate, total area, and total fresh weight of leaves of plants with K(+) supplied at 10 millimolarity was similar to that for leaves from plants at a 2 millimolarity level. Shoot/root ratio and dry weight accumulation, which are indicative of translocation and partitioning over the long term, were independent of K(+) supply in the 2 to 10 millimolarity range. Accumulation of K(+) by exporting leaves and its subsequent recirculation to sinks increased when K(+) supply was increased in this range but did not appear to affect carbon nutrition even after a long period.

Preparation of mouse erythrocyte ghosts by hypotonic lysis caused loss of some minor labelled proteins present on intact cells and shifts to lower molecular weights of others. It is therefore important to solubilize labelled cells directly in electrophoresis buffer to avoid artifactual degradation of labelled proteins. The extent of labelling internal cell proteins was measured by a procedure suitable for the comparison of a large number of samples: solubilized radioiodinated erythrocytes were electrophoresed on 14% acrylamide gels and the radioactivity determined in the haemoglobin band which migrates separately from other proteins. The major labelled protein on the mouse erythrocytes had an apparent molecular weight of 92,000, and may be analogous to Band 3 of the human erythrocyte.

Variables evaluated were gender, age (younger than 41 vs 41 years or older), side (right or left), presence of crossing vessels, presence of a high insertion, primary or secondary procedure and whether prior endopyelotomy or pyeloplasty had been performed. Mean followup for endopyelotomy, laparoscopic pyeloplasty and robotic pyeloplasty was 20, 20 and 19 months, respectively, with success rates of 60.2%, 88.8% and 100%, respectively. On univariable analysis only the presence of crossing vessels or a high insertion was significant for laparoscopic pyeloplasty. On multivariable analysis age was significant for endopyelotomy and the presence of crossing vessels was significant for pyeloplasty. On Kaplan-Meier analysis failures were noted to occur after 5 years in both groups. Laparoscopic pyeloplasty and robotic pyeloplasty are superior minimally invasive treatments for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. However, endopyelotomy can be used for select patients.

The use of thimerosal has caused concern about its ability to cause neurological abnormalities due to mercury accumulation during a normal schedule of childhood vaccinations. While the chemistry and the biological effects of methylmercury have been well-studied, those of thimerosal have not. Thimerosal reacted rapidly with cysteine, GSH, human serum albumin, and single-stranded DNA to form ethylmercury adducts that were detectable by mass spectrometry. These results indicated that thimerosal would be quickly metabolized in vivo because of its reactions with protein and nonprotein thiols. Thimerosal also potently inhibited the decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase II alpha, likely through reaction with critical free cysteine thiol groups. Thimerosal, however, did not act as a topoisomerase II poison and the lack of cross-resistance with a K562 cell line with a decreased level of topoisomerase II alpha (K/VP.5 cells) suggested that inhibition of topoisomerase II alpha was not a significant mechanism for the inhibition of cell growth. Depletion of intracellular GSH with buthionine sulfoximine treatment greatly increased the K562 cell growth inhibitory effects of thimerosal, which showed that intracellular glutathione had a major role in protecting cells from thimerosal. Pretreatment of thimerosal with glutathione did not, however, change its K562 cell growth inhibitory effects, a result consistent with the rapid exchange of the ethylmercury adduct among various thiol-containing cellular reactants. Thimerosal-induced single and double strand breaks in K562 cells were consistent with a rapid induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, these studies have elucidated some of the chemistry and biological activities of the interaction of thimerosal with topoisomerase II alpha and protein and nonprotein thiols and with DNA.

The mean doses were 3.6+/-2.4 mg/day of risperidone and 10.7+/-7.6 mg/day of olanzapine. The VA costs of these mean doses were S3.32/day for risperidone and $6.67/day for olanzapine.

Incidence of parkinsonian symptoms (14% of both risperidone and olanzapine patients) and tardive dyskinesia (3% of risperidone patients and 5% of olanzapine patients) was similar in the two groups. Akathisia tended to occur more often in patients receiving olanzapine than risperidone (14% versus 3%, P=.08).

Only since about 1990 has the presence of HIV/AIDS in Islamic countries cast light on the fact that the actual sexual behaviour of the population does not always conform to religious norms. The increase in the numbers of people with HIV has compelled religious leaders to take a stand on sexual practices they consider \"deviant\", from prostitution to homosexuality and extramarital sex. The aim of this paper is to analyse the attitude of Muslim religious authorities towards individual sexual behaviour and AIDS. It is based mainly on contemporary legal responses that largely provide the necessary information on most of Islamic medical ethics. According to Muslim scholars, AIDS is a warning from God not to indulge in illicit conduct. As a remedy against the spread of AIDS, they encourage compliance with traditional family values and the enhancement of faith and devotion and strongly oppose sex education. They oppose promotion of condoms or any form of safe sex outside of marriage, which they perceive as promoting promiscuity and defiance of divine law. All the above-mentioned arguments are not exhaustive of the Islamic attitude towards AIDS. Some religious groups disagree with such a conservative way of conceiving the fight against AIDS as being antithetical to both men''s and women''s well-being. They support an alternative view of reproductive health and human rights within the Islamic framework and stress the great tolerance of Islam and why it must include people with HIV and AIDS.

In this study we examined the effects of PD 98059, which inhibits the activity of MEK, on in vitro maturation of pig oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in the presence or absence of the drug (50 microM) for various time periods. To elucidate the influence of cumulus cells, COCs were first cultured in inhibitor-free medium, subsequently denuded, and incubated further in PD 98059 supplemented medium. Reversibility of drug action as tested following PD 98059 treatment of COCs by transferring them to drug-free medium. Culture of COCs in medium supplemented with PD 98059 prevents resumption of nuclear maturation in the majority of COCs. This inhibition was reversible and accompanied by a non-activation of both MAP and MPF. Addition of the MEK inhibitor to extracts of in vitro matured oocytes revealed that the kinase activities were not directly influenced by the inhibitor, suggesting a link between MAP and MPF kinases. Preincubation of COCs in inhibitor-free medium for 6 h followed by further culture of COCs or denuded oocytes in the presence of PD 98059 for various periods resulted in elevated MAP and MPF kinase activities, indicating an early and transient MEK signalling in the oocyte itself. These results support the idea that MAP and MPF are involved in the induction of germinal vesicle breakdown in porcine oocytes.

Patients with nonviral microbial keratitis seen at L.V. Prasad Eye Institute between February 1991 and December 1998 were included in the study. The type of bacteria seen on Gram stain was determined from 251 corneal scrapings from patients with early keratitis and 841 corneal scrapings from patients with advanced keratitis. The presence of fungi in corneal scrapings was determined by KOH+CFW stain of 114 and 363 scrapings from patients with early and advanced keratitis, respectively. The smear findings were compared with culture results to analyze specificity, sensitivity, and predictive values of the staining techniques. The sensitivity of Gram stain in the detection of bacteria was 36.0% in early and 40.9% in advanced keratitis cases; however, the specificity was higher in both groups (84.9% and 87.1%, respectively). Comparatively, the sensitivity and specificity of fungal detection were higher using KOH+CFW in early (61.1% and 99.0%, respectively) as well as advanced keratitis (87.7% and 83.7%, respectively). Predictive values were high for KOH+CFW in fungus detection, while they were poor for Gram stain in bacteria detection. In advanced keratitis cases, the false positives were higher in fungal detection (16.3%) than in bacterial detection (10.3%), while the false negatives were significantly higher in bacterial detection compared with fungal detection (59.1% versus 12.3%, p< 0.0001). In early keratitis, on the other hand, both false positives and false negatives for bacterial detection were significantly higher than fungal detection. Decisions can reliably be based on KOH+CFW stain of corneal scrapings for initiation of antifungal therapy in mycotic keratitis. The results of Gram stain, on the other hand, have limited value in therapeutic decisions for bacterial keratitis. Therefore, the search for a better modality for early and efficient diagnosis of bacterial keratitis needs to continue.

In a search for the ligands of the SH3 domain of p130(cas) by far-Western screening, we cloned a novel protein named CIZ (for Cas-interacting zinc finger protein). CIZ consists of the following: a putative leucine zipper; a serine/threonine-rich region; a proline-rich sequence; five, six, or eight Krüppel-type C(2)H(2) zinc fingers; and the glutamine-alanine repeat. CIZ binds Cas in cells and is located in the nucleus and at focal adhesions. We showed that CIZ is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, by using the transient interspecies heterokaryon formation assay. In order to search for the targets of CIZ in nucleus, we determined the DNA binding consensus of CIZ as (G/C)AAAAA(A) by cyclic amplification and selection of targets analysis. The consensus-like sequences are found in several promoters of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are the enzymes used to degrade the extracellular matrix proteins. CIZ binds to a consensus-like sequence in the MMP-1 (collagenase) promoter. Overexpression of CIZ upregulates the transcriptions from MMP-1, MMP-3 (stromelysin), and MMP-7 (matrilysin) promoters, and this transactivation was enhanced in the presence of Cas. Furthermore, the stable overexpression of CIZ promoted the production of MMP-7 in culture medium. In summary, CIZ, a novel zinc finger protein, binds Cas, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and regulates the expression of MMPs.

To evaluate the effect of the protein component alone on lipid variables, ethanol-extracted, isoflavone-depleted soy protein isolate (SPe) was studied in ovarian hormone-deficient hamsters. Forty-eight 6-month-old female Golden Syrian hamsters were either sham-operated or ovariectomized and fed casein-based or SPe-based diets for 70 d. Ovariectomy, but not protein source, significantly (P < 0.05) increased serum phospholipids and total, non-high density lipoprotein, free and esterified cholesterol concentrations. Serum HDL cholesterol concentrations were not altered with either treatment. No significant differences were observed in liver total lipids or liver total cholesterol among the groups. Soy protein isolate, however, lowered serum triglyceride concentrations in both sham-operated and ovariectomized hamsters. These findings confirm the ovariectomized hamster as a model of postmenopausal hypercholesterolemia. The results are consistent with earlier observations that isoflavones or other nonprotein components, perhaps in combination with soy protein, play an important role in exerting this hypocholesterolemic effect. Further studies are needed to investigate whether isolated nonprotein components of soy would be able to prevent the ovarian hormone deficiency-associated rise in serum cholesterol regardless of dietary protein source.

This study was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel study in which fifty-four middle-aged subjects received either inulin or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected before the supplementation period (baseline samples 1 and 2, separated by 1 week) and at weeks 4 and 8, with a follow-up at week 12. Compared with baseline values, insulin concentrations were significantly lower at 4 weeks (P < 0.01) in the inulin group. There was a trend for TAG values, compared with baseline, to be lower in the inulin group at 8 weeks (P < 0.08) returning to baseline concentrations at week 12. On comparison of the inulin and placebo groups, the fasting TAG responses over the 8-week test period were shown to be significantly different (P < 0.05, repeated measures ANOVA), which was largely due to lower plasma TAG levels in the inulin group at week 8. The percentage change in TAG levels in the inulin group during the 8-week study was shown to correlate with the initial TAG level of the subjects (rs -0.499, P = 0.004). We therefore conclude that the daily addition of 10 g inulin to the diet significantly reduced fasting insulin concentrations during the 8-week test period and resulted in lower plasma TAG levels, particularly in subjects in whom fasting TAG levels were greater than 1.5 mmol/l. These data support findings from animal studies that fructans influence the formation and/or degradation of TAG-rich lipoprotein particles, and the insulin data are also consistent with recent studies showing attenuation of insulin levels in fructan-treated rats.

Good experiences have been gained with the risk policy that applies to some 4000 establishments in the Netherlands where hazardous substances are present. On the basis of these experiences, legislation is now being prepared to give the risk tolerability criteria a full legal basis. This is aimed, in particular, to balance between risk control measures at the source through the licensing system, and spatial planning instruments to protect, e.g. residential areas against major hazards. The revision of the Seveso directive (96/82/EC) leads to the implementation of an integrated form of safety reporting, evaluation and inspection. Practical tools were developed for this implementation, e.g. for facilitating the selection of establishments and for assessing risks from major hazard establishments to surface water. In the past few years, the application of risk-based safety policy has been extended to other fields than establishments, e.g. for transport of hazardous chemicals and external safety of airports.

To date, chemotherapeutic treatment yielded disappointing results in these patients with 5-year survival rates of 0-15%, leading to therapeutic nihilism in many patients. However, with the availability of new cytostatic agents as well as the introduction of the novel clinical endpoint \"clinical benefit response\" at least some improvements may be possible in patients with pancreatic cancer. Several randomized studies have shown a clinical and survival benefit for patients treated with chemotherapy as compared to patients treated with best supportive care alone. Gemcitabine was the first agent, which was investigated for its potential to improve symptoms as well as overall well being. A significant clinical benefit response can be achieved in up to 40% of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is currently also investigated in combination chemotherapy regimens. First results with combination chemotherapy regimens such as cisplatin/gemcitabine have shown promising results. In addition, taxanes such as docetaxel also appear to have a certain activity in patients with pancreatic cancer. In contrast, topoisomerase I-inhibiting drugs seems to have no efficacy in the treatment of this disease. New and experimental therapeutic options such as angiogenesis-inhibition, matrixmetalloproteinase-inhibition or the use of monoclonal antibodies are currently evaluated within clinical studies. Only a few small studies reporting about chemotherapy in patients with biliary tract cancer have been published. This is mainly due to the rarity of this tumor entity, but also due to the rapid onset of symptoms such as hyperbilirubinemia, which will limit the number of potentially available drugs. 5-FU is the most widely investigated drug inducing remissions in 10-15% of patients. It is unclear whether new agents such as gemcitabine or the taxanes will led to an improvement of the prognosis of these patients. Although the recent advances in the treatment with these new therapeutic options are far from being satisfactory, it appears that a first small step ahead has been made the treatment of these diseases.

The emerging crisis in the preservation of modern health records.', 'In this brief essay we argue that the best efforts of archivists, scholars, and practitioners within the National Health Service have not prevented the wholesale destruction of the bulk of patient records created during the twentieth century. This is a matter of vital concern not merely for historians of modern medicine. Important clinical work has frequently been undertaken on materials which have survived, usually by chance or by the foresight of physicians, matrons, and administrators. Even the significant fragments of historical documents which remain in the hands of the health authorities have been threatened by the continuing drive to reduce storage and maintenance costs within hospitals. Archivists and academics have struggled to address the problems of sampling, storage, and access which the enormous bulk of modern records present. In this essay we suggest that the first step must be to raise awareness amongst professionals and the public of the extent to which any future history of the medical services and of patient care will depend on a reasonable rate of survival of these records. The second step must be to confront the problem of resources and the inevitable task of selection which must form the foundations of any long-term policy of preservation. An initial survey of archival materials in Devon indicates that the records of community health care form a substantial and potentially invaluable research source for future historians, though their relevance has rarely been recognized within the academic community.

Three tagging techniques: EPISTAR, PICORE, and FAIR are found to give very similar perfusion results despite large differences in static tissue contrast. Two major sources of systematic error in the perfusion measurement are identified: the transit delay from the tagging region to the imaging slice; and the inclusion of intravascular tagged signal. A modified technique called QUIPSS II is described that decreases sensitivity to these effects by explicitly controlling the time width of the tag bolus and imaging after the bolus is entirely deposited into the slice. With appropriate saturation pulses the pulse sequence can be arranged so as to allow for simultaneous collection of perfusion and BOLD data that can be cleanly separated. Such perfusion and BOLD signals reveal differences in spatial location and dynamics that may be useful both for functional brain mapping and for study of the BOLD contrast mechanism. The implementation of multislice perfusion imaging introduces additional complications, primarily in the elimination of signal from static tissue. In pulsed ASL, this appears to be related to the slice profile of the inversion tag pulse in the presence of relaxation, rather than magnetization transfer effects as in continuous arterial spin labeling, and can be alleviated with careful adjustment of inversion pulse parameters.

Relatively little is known about ALS as compared to the other components of the complex. We report immunoblot studies of ALS using a new rabbit antiserum to human ALS1-34. The antiserum shows high specificity for ALS, labelling only the intact 82-88 kDa doublet in whole serum. Treatment with endoglycosidase-F leads to only a partial deglycosylation of ALS in whole serum, while purified ALS is reduced to M(r) approximately 58 kDa. Acidification of both whole serum and purified ALS leads to a complete loss of ALS ability to bind to cross-linked IGFBP-3:[125I]IGF-II tracer; however, immunoblot studies show no change in the apparent M(r) of the major ALS band. Immunoblot studies of human serum shows that intact ALS is decreased in growth-hormone (GH) deficiency, increases with GH treatment, is elevated in GH excess and is unchanged with IGF-I treatment.

Based on these data, local effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the expanding mid-palatal suture of the rat were examined. Single doses of human recombinant (rhu) TGF-beta 1 (40 and 200 ng, and 1 microgram) were injected into the expanding mid-palatal suture 24 hours after expansion started. Calcein was also injected immediately, and 6 and 12 days after expansion. The width of each calcein label was measured to evaluate bone formation along the suture with bone histomorphometry. In the experimental groups, bone formation during the 12-day expansion period was stimulated significantly (P < 0.05), in a dose-dependent manner, compared with that in the control group. Furthermore, bone formation during the later stage (6-12 days) of the 12-day expansion period, was still significantly higher than that in the control group. In addition, the amount of bone formation in response to a course of 3 injections of 200 ng rhu TGF-beta 1 on days 3, 6, and 9 was almost equal to that induced by a single injection of 200 ng rhu TGF-beta 1 on day 1. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 may play an important role in bone formation at the active site of the suture in response to rapid palatal expansion and application of TGF-beta 1 during the early stages may induce rapid bone formation.

Following intraneural injection of RCA into the three main forelimb nerves, namely the radial, ulnar and median nerves, terminal degeneration of the primary afferent fibres in the ECN was studied under the light microscope by means of the Fink-Heimer method. The results show that the primary afferent fibres from these three nerves project to the medial part of the ECN. The field of terminal degeneration take a crescentic form. The projection from the median nerve was most dorsally located whereas that from the radial nerve was the most ventral with extensive overlaps between them. Of the three nerves, the projection from the radial nerve was the most dense. Rostrocaudally, the three nerves also show extensive overlaps. The rostrocaudal extent of maximum terminal degeneration was greatest for the radial nerve and least for the median nerve.

We attempted to solve this problem by studying the NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons in the hamster retina. From the NADPH-diaphorase histochemical reaction, two distinct types of neurons in the hamster retina were identified. They were named ND(g) and ND(i) cells. The ND(g) cells were cells with larger somata, ranging from 10 to 21 microns in diameter with a mean of 15.58 microns (S.D. = 2.59). They were found in the ganglion cell layer only. The ND(i) cells were smaller, with the somata ranging from 7 to 11 microns and having the mean diameter of 8.77 microns (S.D. = 1.24). Most of the ND(i) cells were found in the inner nuclear layer, and only very few could be observed in the inner plexiform layer. On average, there were 8,033 ND(g) and 5,051 ND(i) cells in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer, respectively. Two experiments were performed to clarify whether any of the NADPH-diaphorase neurons were retinal ganglion cells. Following unilateral optic nerve section, which leads to the retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, the numbers of both ND(g) and ND(i) cells did not change significantly for up to 4 months. In addition, when retinal ganglion cells were prelabeled retrogradely (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent microspheres) and retinas were then stained for NADPH diaphorase, no double-labeled neurons were detected. These results indicated that the NADPH-diaphorase neurons in the hamster retina were the amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer and displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer. Dendrites of the ND(g) and ND(i) cells were found to stratify in sublaminae 1, 3, and 5 of the inner plexiform layer, with a prominent staining in the sublamina 5.

To study the importance of these conserved RPR1 RNA regions in enzyme function, three independent mutational libraries were created in which the positions of invariant nucleotides were randomized simultaneously. Screening in vivo was used to identify viable RPR1 variants when reconstituted into holoenzyme in cells. Despite the universal evolutionary conservation, most of these positions tolerate certain sequence changes without severely affecting function. Most changes, however, produced subtle defects in cell growth and RNase P function, supporting the importance of these conserved regions. Isolation of conditional growth mutants allowed the characterization of the effects of mutations on cell growth, RPR1 RNA maturation, and activity of the holoenzyme in vitro.

However, in parotid acinar cells, the process of Ca2+ entry and the identity of factors which regulate it remain obscure. In this report, we demonstrate that AlF-4, like carbachol, activates Ca2+ entry into dispersed rat parotid acini. In physiological Ca2(+)-containing (1.28 mM) medium, both agents elicit three phases of cytosolic Ca2+ change, an initial transient increase (intracellular Ca2+ dependent) followed sequentially by a decrease (intra- and extracellular Ca2+ dependent) and a small sustained increase (extracellular Ca2+ dependent). Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) during the last two phases is influenced by variations in extracellular [Ca2+]. Elevation of extracellular [Ca2+], at any time after the initial transient increase, results in a rise of cytosolic [Ca2+], thus demonstrating the existence of a Ca2+ entry pathway during the two later phases. These data suggest the likelihood that in parotid acini, G protein activation is involved in stimulating this Ca2+ entry pathway. Because in AlF-4-treated acini entry into the cytosol is detectable only after the initial intracellular Ca2+ release phase, we suggest that this Ca2+ entry process does not accompany initial intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Furthermore, the sustained cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation which can be observed 15-30 min after initial stimulation of acini is likely determined by this Ca2+ entry process which, in physiological conditions, could support sustained fluid secretion.

The role of the 3''-untranslated region (3''-UTR) in GM-CSF mRNA stabilization induced by TPA and ConA in EL-4 cells was examined by transfection studies using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructions. The GM-CSF 3''-UTR contains a 63-nucleotide region at its 3'' end with repeating ATTTA motifs which is responsible for mRNA degradation in a variety of cell types (Shaw, G., and Kamen, R. (1986) Cell 46, 659-666). We produced constructs containing most of the GM-CSF 3''-UTR (303 nucleotides, pRSV-CATgm) or the 3''-terminal AT-rich region (116 nucleotides, pRSV-CATau) and measured CAT enzyme activity and CAT mRNA after transient transfection into EL-4 and NIH 3T3 cells. Low levels of CAT activity were seen in both cells with either plasmid compared with levels of CAT activity obtained with pRSV-CAT. TPA treatment caused an approximately 10-fold increase in CAT activity and mRNA in EL-4 cells transfected with pRSV-CATgm. No increases were seen in EL-4 cells transfected with pRSV-CATau or pRSV-CAT. No response to TPA was detected in transfected NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that the response to TPA is relatively cell-specific. There was no increase in CAT activity after ConA treatment in EL-4 or NIH 3T3 cells transfected with any of the constructs suggesting that the GM-CSF 3''-UTR lacks elements that can respond alone to ConA. Nuclear run-on and actinomycin D chase experiments in EL-4 cells showed that TPA induces CAT activity via mRNA stabilization. By linker-substitution mutagenesis we show that TPA inducibility depends on a 60-nucleotide region of the 3''-UTR whose 5'' end is located 160 nucleotides upstream of the 5'' end of the AU-rich region.

After a short lag, RNA and virus synthesis proceeded at a constant rate for at least 24 hr, during which time most of the synthesis was directed to the production of RNAs 2 and 3. The kinetics of [14C]uridine incorporation into the sat RNA molecules after increasing times of incubation and during pulses of [14C]uridine followed by chase incubation with excess [12C]uridine suggest that RNA 3 is a percursor of RNA 2. However, not all the RNA 3 synthesized was shown to end up as RNA 2, even after 72 hr of incubation. Several lines of evidence are presented supporting the conclusion that VTMoV-infected cells contain large pools of unencapsidated sat RNA. It is suggested that the sat RNA may have a greater affinity for the VTMoV replicase than the helper viral RNA which results in copious production of the sat RNA.

Previous work has demonstrated that acid phosphatase release is a reliable index of DBE-induced cytotoxicity in an in vitro system of rat nasal explants. In the present study, rat nasal explants were examined microscopically and ultrastructurally following incubation in varying concentrations of a representative DBE, dimethyl adipate (DMA). DMA-induced microscopic and ultrastructural changes in rat nasal explants correlated well with biochemical perturbations associated with DBE exposure in a previous study. In both studies, olfactory epithelium was more susceptible to DMA-induced toxicity than respiratory epithelium and DMA-induced nasal toxicity was attenuated by pretreatment with a carboxylesterase inhibitor. The results of this study support the hypothesis that DBE and potentially other inhaled organic esters induce nasal toxicity via a common mechanism, carboxylesterase-mediated production of toxic acid metabolites. It was established that carboxylesterase-rich sustentacular cells are the primary target cells for DBE toxicity in rat nasal explants. It was proposed that degeneration of nasal olfactory sensory cells observed in rats following 90-day inhalation exposure to DBE may be secondary to necrosis and loss of sustentacular cells.

These changes were compared to the normal pattern of hormone release during the estrous cycle, as well as to the ovulatory and gestational history of control animals. Measurement of plasma inhibin levels with antibodies raised against the N-terminus part of the alpha-chain of the molecule indicated an increase in immunoreactive inhibin-alpha release during the afternoon of proestrus, followed by a marked decline after the primary gonadotropin surge. Removal of endogenous inhibin by the iv injection of anti-inhibin serum on diestrus-1 caused the expected rise in plasma FSH, but not LH values. FSH secretion remained elevated for approximately 28 h, then returned to baseline. While not altering vaginal cytology, the injection of the antiserum during diestrus-1 or -2, and to a lesser degree, during estrus, caused a marked increase in the number of tubal ova shed during the subsequent estrus. However, plasma estrogen and progesterone remained comparable at all times between control and treated animals. In female rats mated after inhibin immunoneutralization at diestrus-1, the increase in ovulation rate resulted in a significant increase in developing fetuses, but only ca. 40% of the pups survived. In order to assess whether elevated FSH secretion represented the primary mechanism through which removal of endogenous inhibin increased the number of maturing follicles, ovine FSH was infused for 35 h starting in diestrus-1 or diestrus-2. Similar to the treatment with the anti-inhibin serum, FSH infusion caused an increase the number of eggs present in the oviducts on the next day of estrus. These results support the existence of a close functional relationship between the circulating levels of FSH and inhibin in the female rat. They also indicate that immunization against inhibin increases ovulation rate, a phenomenon probably mediated through elevated levels of circulating FSH.

In patients with EEG monitoring the changes in waveform pattern paralleled the clinical response. Effects could be detected within 1-2 min after flumazenil injection and lasted up to 45 min. There were no adverse reactions or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose.

Specific gene fragments are 3'' end-labeled using a sequence-specific oligonucleotide to direct the site of labeling, and photoproducts are identified by enzymatic incision. On the nontranscribed strand of the E. coli lacI gene, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer frequency was 2- to 8-fold higher in chromosomal DNA than in a cloned DNA fragment. The chromosomal lesion frequency corresponded to the frequency of UV-induced mutations at mutation hot spots reported in the literature. Only 0-30% of cyclobutane dimers at various sites on this strand were excised in 20 min. In contrast, repair on the transcribed strand was 80-90% complete in 20 min. However, the transcribed strand contained an excision repair \"slow spot\" at the site of its single mutation hot spot: At this site, no repair occurred for the first 10 min, after which repair proceeded more slowly than typical of that strand. In an mfd strain, deficient in a factor that couples repair to transcription in cell extracts, the excision rate at individual nucleotides on the transcribed strand was minimal at most sites for at least 30 min. Wild-type E. coli''s bias for producing mutations at photoproducts on the nontranscribed strand, reported to require the mfd gene, therefore appears to be due to an excision repair system specific for the transcribed strand of chromosomal DNA.

The region responsible for N-terminal trimerization (formation of a triple alpha-helical coiled-coil) is located at the N-terminal one-third of sigma1. In this study, we investigated the temporality and ATP requirement of this trimerization event in the context of sigma1 biogenesis. In vitro co-synthesis of the full-length (FL) and a C-terminally truncated (d44) sigma1 protein revealed a preference for homotrimer over heterotrimer formation, suggesting that assembly at the N-terminus occurs co-translationally. This was corroborated by the observation that polysome-associated sigma1 chains were trimeric as well as monomeric. Truncated proteins (d234 and d294) with C-terminal deletions exceeding half the length of sigma1 were found to trimerize post-translationally. This trimerization did not require ATP since it proceeded normally in the presence of apyrase. In contrast, formation of stable FL sigma1 trimers was inhibited by apyrase treatment.

Ancylobacter aquaticus A7, Pseudomonas P1, and Methylobacterium CP13, strains indigenous to a BKME treatment system, were tested for growth on chlorinated acetic acids and alcohols, and for adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) reduction in batch cultures of sterile BKME from three sources. A. aquaticus A7 exhibited the broadest substrate range, but could only affect significant AOX reduction in softwood effluents. Methylobacterium CP13 exhibited a limited substrate range, but was capable of removing significant amounts of AOX from both hardwood and softwood effluents. By contrast, Pseudomonas sp. P1 exhibited a limited substrate range and poor to negligible reductions in AOX levels from both effluent types. Mixed inocula of all three species combined and inocula of sludge from mill treatment systems removed as much AOX from softwood effluents as did pure populations of Methylobacterium CP13. When BKME was hydrolysed prior to AOX analysis, the subsequent estimates of recalcitrant, or non-hydrolysable, AOX levels were far less variable than their counterpart total AOX measures. It is suggested that this is a relevant and useful measure of AOX for biodegradation studies.

  UNION SELECT 17796480, '7767884', 'Smooth muscle protein kinase C.', 'Protein kinase C (PKC) was first implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction with the observation that phorbol esters induce slowly developing, sustained contractions. In some vascular smooth muscles, e.g., ferret aorta, phorbol ester induced contractions occur without an increase in sarcoplasmic free-Ca2+ concentration ([Ca]i) or myosin light chain phosphorylation. This response appears to be mediated by a Ca(2+)-independent isoenzyme of PKC (probably PKC epsilon), since saponin-permeabilized single ferret aortic smooth muscle cells, which retain receptor coupling, developed force in response to phenylephrine at low free [Ca2+] (pCa 7.0-8.6) and the constitutively active proteolytic fragment of PKC (PKM) elicited a contraction at pCa 7 comparable with the phenylephrine-induced contraction. Both contractions were reversed by a pseudo-substrate peptide inhibitor of PKC. These observations suggest a mechanism whereby alpha-adrenergic agonists may elicit a contractile response without a Ca2+ signal: alpha-adrenergic stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C or D (the latter in conjunction with phosphatidate phosphohydrolase) generates diacylglycerol. In the absence of an increase in [Ca2+]i, diacylglycerol specifically activates so-called novel PKCs, of which epsilon is the only isoenzyme known to be expressed in vascular smooth muscle. Recent evidence suggests that PKC may trigger a cascade of phosphorylation reactions, resulting in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation of the thin filament associated protein caldesmon. Alternatively, or additionally, PKC may directly phosphorylate calponin, another thin filament associated protein. These phosphorylations are predicted to alleviate inhibition of the cross-bridge cycling rate by these thin-filament proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ', '', 'Animals,Humans,Isoenzymes,Muscle Contraction,Muscle, Smooth,Protein Kinase C'

In the selection of the population, exclusion criteria included diseases, use of drugs and toxic habits (smoking and alcoholism) known to affect bone and mineral metabolism. The study population comprised 131 healthy females, ages 20 to 69 years. Spinal radiographs were taken of women age 60 or more to exclude spinal defects or artifacts. The bone mineral densities were measured using the dual energy X Ray absorptiometer (DEXA, Hologic model 1000). The peak BMD was found in the lumbar spine at the age 30 to 39 years and at the age 20 to 29 years in the femoral neck, trochanter and Ward''s triangle. The decrease in BMD from peak values to those at age 60 to 69 years were 18% for the lumbar spine, 16.3% for the femoral neck, 30.1% for the Ward''s triangle and 12.4% for the trochanter.

Therefore, the authors examined the effect of ketamine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced and calcium ionophore A23187-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production in thioglycolate (TGC)-elicited peritoneal macrophages (MPs) in ddY mice. Ketamine was added to TGC-elicited MPs at various times after the stimulation with LPS or A23187. After the MPs were stimulated by LPS or A23187 and incubated, TNF-alpha activities in the supernatant of MPs were determined by an L929 cytotoxic assay. In vivo, the ddY mice were injected intraperitoneally with TGC. Four days later, they were injected subcutaneously with ketamine and then injected intravenously with LPS. Two hours after the LPS challenge, TNF-alpha activities of the sera were determined. Ketamine suppressed both LPS-induced and A23187-induced TNF-alpha production in a dose-dependent manner. The simultaneous addition of ketamine to LPS-stimulated and A23187-stimulated MPs resulted in a 50% inhibition of TNF-alpha production at 20 micrograms/ml and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Ketamine also caused a significant suppression of TNF-alpha production even when added to the MPs 2 h after the LPS challenge. There was a significant decrease in A23187-induced TNF-alpha production in TGC-elicited MPs in a calcium-depleted medium when compared with that in a calcium-containing medium. Conversely, LPS-induced TNF-alpha production did not cause such a result. In addition, ketamine could suppress LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in TGC-pretreated mice in vivo.

Effects of calcium on the chaperone and anti-chaperone activity of protein disulfide-isomerase.', 'Protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) catalyzes the formation and isomerization of disulfides during oxidative protein folding in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum. At high concentrations, it also serves as a chaperone and inhibits aggregation. However, at lower concentrations, PDI can display the unusual ability to facilitate aggregation, termed anti-chaperone activity (Puig, A., and Gilbert, H. F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7764-7771). Under reducing conditions (10 mM dithiothreitol) and at a low concentration (0.1-0. 3 microM) relative to the unfolded protein substrate, PDI facilitates aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (11 microM) that has been denatured thermally or chemically. But at higher concentrations (>0.8 microM), PDI inhibits aggregation under the same conditions. With denatured citrate synthase, PDI does not facilitate aggregation, but higher concentrations do inhibit aggregation. Anti-chaperone behavior is associated with the appearance of both PDI and substrate proteins in insoluble complexes, while chaperone behavior results in the formation of large (>500 kDa) but soluble complexes that contain both proteins. Physiological concentrations of calcium and magnesium specifically increase the apparent rate of PDI-dependent aggregation and shift the chaperone activity to higher PDI concentrations. However, calcium has no effect on the Km or Vmax for PDI-catalyzed oxidative folding, suggesting that the interactions that lead to chaperone/anti-chaperone behavior are distinct from those required for catalytic activity. To account for this unusual behavior of a folding catalyst, a model with analogy to classic immunoprecipitation is proposed; multivalent interactions between PDI and a partially aggregated protein stimulate further aggregate formation by noncovalently cross-linking smaller aggregates. However, at high ratios of PDI to substrate, cross-linking may be inhibited by saturation of the sites with PDI. The effects of PDI concentration on substrate aggregation and the modulation of the behavior by physiological levels of calcium may have implications for the involvement of PDI in protein folding, aggregation, and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum.

As suggested by the evaluation on the secondary endpoint in the phase III comparative studies with both bacterial pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infections, it was confirmed that the 7 day therapy of CFLP was promising for treatment of moderate bacterial pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infections, because the high clinical efficacy was obtained and also the incidence of allergic reactions with CFLP was almost the same as that of ceftazidime (CAZ) evaluated highly safe. Based on these results, it was concluded that CFLP was useful in the management of moderate respiratory tract infections and also the recommended therapeutic period with CFLP was within 7 days.

The median firing frequencies of nine motor units were in the 16-25 Hz range, in agreement with previous studies. One additional motor unit had a median firing frequency of 47 Hz. This unit and one of the lower-frequency units regularly fired doublets. Motor-unit firing frequency was well correlated to whole-muscle EMG during locomotion. Integrated rectified gross EMG revealed periods of continuous modulation, phasic high-amplitude events, and tonic low-amplitude segments. The tonic segments typically were caused by a small number of motor units firing at stable high frequencies (20-30 Hz) for extended periods of time without detectable activity in other units. This long-lasting firing in single motor units typically was initiated by transient mass activity, which recruited many units. However, only one or a few units continued firing at a stable high frequency. The tonic firing terminated spontaneously or in conjunction with an episode of mass activity. Different units were active in different tonic segments. Thus there was an apparent dissociation between activity in different single motor units and consequently between single-motor-unit activity and whole-muscle EMG. It is proposed that the maintained tonic motor-unit activity is caused by intrinsic motoneuron properties in the form of depolarizing plateau potentials.

The LMW heparin was administered as a single bolus in hemodialysis that usually lasted for four hours or less. The regimen for administering LMW heparin in hemodialysis of longer duration (5 hours or more) is not well documented and manufacturers recommend a supplementary dose equivalent to one-quarter of the initial dose to be given at 4 hours after the commencement of hemodialysis. In this study, we explored whether administering a single dose of LMW heparin is feasible in hemodialysis of longer duration. Maintenance five-hour hemodialysis sessions were performed in nine uremic patients with two different heparin regimens: single dose of LMW heparin (nadroparin) 12,500 ICU AXa at the beginning of dialysis or a priming dose of nadroparin 10,000 ICU AXa at the beginning of dialysis followed by a supplementary dose of nadroparin 2,500 ICU AXa at the beginning of the fifth hour of dialysis. Clots in the airtraps or clotting of the dialyser were not observed in hemodialysis with the single dose heparin regimen. The anti-Xa activities at different time intervals during dialysis were above the therapeutic range of 0.5 U/ml except towards the end of the hemodialysis treatment. There was no difference between anti-Xa activities determined in dialysis sessions using two different regimens of LMW heparin at any individual time interval. The anti-thrombotic effect determined by the area under the time response curve for anti-Xa activity was comparable in the two LMW heparin regimens. Hence, our findings suggest a single bolus dose of LMW heparin (nadroparin) at 12,500 ICU AXa provides adequate, safe, and effective anti-coagulation for five-hour hemodialysis. This practice is convenient and avoids the necessity of administering a double dose of LMW heparin.

Thus, complementary methods of monitoring the impact of trauma system initiatives should be considered. The objective of this study is to use National Highway Safety Traffic Administration''s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and New York State Department of Motor Vehicles data and to study the impact of state and regional initiatives over a 10-year period in the seven-county Hudson Valley New York (HV) region with one regional TC in Westchester County (WC) and to assess its face validity. FARS data for the United States (US), New York State (NY), the HV region, and WC were analyzed from 1987 to 1996. Trauma system initiatives included the following. Statewide: (1) TC standards (1989), (2) TC designation and funding (1990), (3) State Trauma Advisory Committee (1991), (4) BLS triage protocol and trauma registry (1993), and (5) quality improvement site surveys (1994). Regional: (1) one regional and two area TCs (1990), (2) helicopter services (1992 and 1994), (3) two additional area TCs, and (4) E 911 in all three counties (1995). The results were presented to the New York State Trauma Advisory Committee. Although nationally motor vehicle crash deaths/100,000 persons have plateaued since 1991, trauma system initiatives have been temporally associated with death rates continuing to diminish in New York, the HV, and WC. From 1987 to 1996, the HV death rate dropped from 17.00 to 9.45, a 44% drop; and the WC rate dropped from 12.51 to 7.05, a 44% drop compared with United States death rate drop of 16% (p < 0.005). The percentage of seriously injured trauma patients going to the trauma centers increased from 53% in 1990 to 72% in 1995 (p < 0.001). The STAC felt that the data reflected in part effects of New York State trauma system initiatives. The drops in motor vehicle crash death rates may reflect injury prevention as well as trauma system initiatives. Thus, although FARS and New York State Department of Motor Vehicles data cannot establish cause and effect relationships, it can monitor the aggregated impact of multiple initiatives. Taken together with increasing percentages of seriously injured trauma patients going to trauma centers and comparisons with national FARS data, the association of decreasing deaths with the implementation of a trauma system seems to have face validity.

The immunoblot assay was used to detect serum antibodies against CagA and VacA obtained from the following patients: 87 cases of nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD), 61 cases of duodenal ulcer (DU), 49 cases of gastric ulcer (GU), and 10 cases of gastric cancer (GC). Serum antibodies to CagA were detected in 75.4% of all patients (70. 1% of NUD, 78.7% of DU, 77.6% of GU, and 90% of GC). Although the prevalence of CagA seropositivity in GC patients was higher than in the other three groups, the difference was not statistically significant (p >.05). The high seroprevalence of the CagA-positive H. pylori strain in patients with peptic ulcer, GC, and NUD indicates that this strain is common in Thai patients with gastroduodenal diseases. Furthermore, phenotypic classification of H. pylori into type 1 (CagA-positive, VacA-positive) and type 2 (CagA-negative, VacA-negative) is not a useful marker for screening patients with severe forms of gastroduodenal diseases.

In most studies, the investigations are performed on biological materials coming from common laboratory animals and the extrapolation of the results to other animals is not easy. For some studies, such as developmental biology of the nervous system, prion disease investigations, or agronomical production, the utilization of ovine neural cell cultures presents many advantages. Unfortunately, there are few data on the conditions of culture of such cells. In the present work, we investigated simple ways to obtain neurons and astrocytes from sheep brain. Viable neuronal cell cultures were obtained from 40 to 50 day old fetuses. Their morphologies were quite similar to that of neurons from rodent or chick brain and they were labeled by antineurofilament antibodies. Stages older than 50 days of pregnancy were unable to give viable culture of neurons. The stages of 40 day old fetus to newborn lamb were able to give viable astrocyte cultures. The common protoplasmic astrocytes were obtained and they were labeled by antiglial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies. The astrocytes contained glycogen, thus looking like the common astrocytes from rodents. Neuronal or astroglial cultures can be derived from 26 day old embryos, but the cultures contained contaminating cells. Among the latter cells, there were undifferentiated cells which were flat and epitheloid and which were grouped as islets. These cells could be maintained in culture for a time duration over 7 months, even after two passages. They differentiated principally in astrocytes with a radial configuration. This work shows how some neural cells can be simply and easily cultured from sheep brain. For the first time, neurons were cultured from the sheep embryonic brain. Moreover, stem cells were cultured for more than 7 months and, finally, glycogen accumulation in sheep astrocytes was shown to be the same as that in rodent astrocytes. The oligodendrocyte culture was already documented. Thus, sheep can easily be used as well as other models for neural cell studies.

Inosine was found to do the following: (a) compete for [125I]N6-aminobenzyladenosine binding to recombinant rat A3 adenosine receptors (A3AR) with an IC50 of 25+/-6 microM; (b) not bind to A1 or A2A ARs; (c) bind to newly identified A3ARs in guinea pig lung (IC50 = 15+/-4 microM); (d) lower cyclic AMP in HEK-293 cells expressing rat A3ARs (ED50 = 12+/-5 microM); (e) stimulate RBL-2H3 rat mast-like cell degranulation (ED50 = 2.3+/-0.9 microM); and (f) cause mast cell-dependent constriction of hamster cheek pouch arterioles that is attenuated by A3AR blockade. Inosine differs from adenosine in not activating A2AARs that dilate vascular smooth muscle and inhibit mast cell degranulation. The A3 selectivity of inosine may explain why it elicits a monophasic arteriolar constrictor response distinct from the multiphasic dilator/constrictor response to adenosine.

Rats suffering from a 30% burn received an enteral diet containing 30% GLU (m/w to total amino acids; GLU group), 30% GLN (GLN group), or a standard amino acid formula (CTR group). After a 64-hour feeding period, the small intestine and the portal and arterial blood were harvested to observe portal and arterial amino acid levels, and glutaminase activity and glutathione in the jejunal mucosa. In another study, 3H uptake into the mucosal protein was examined after a massive dose injection of 3H-phenylalanine. Alanine, a product of GLN or GLU catabolism, significantly increased in the portal blood of the GLU group compared with the GLN group. In the gut mucosa of the GLU group, 3H uptake into protein and total glutathione were higher than those of other two groups. GLN did not elevate the glutaminase activity. Arterial GLU levels increased in the GLU group, however remained within safety limits. Enterally delivered GLU may be a preferable fuel for the enterocytes and enhance the mucosal protein synthesis.

Increased blood pressure in both strains is associated with increased urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of blood pressure on body balance of these ions in Dahl rats on HSLK diet. Two groups of S and two groups of R weanlings were all placed on HSLK diet (NaCl=8%, K=0.2%) for eight weeks. One group of each strain was subjected to chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to counteract hypertension development. Urinary norepinephrine was used to determine efficacy of 6-OHDA treatment. Systolic blood pressures of conscious animals were measured daily throughout the study. The last three days on the diet were used to determine total dietary intake and urinary as well as fecal excretion of sodium, calcium and magnesium. At the end of the study, extracellular fluid volume, serum aldosterone and parathyroid hormone were analyzed. Final systolic blood pressures in the 4 groups were as follows: S=235+/-9 mmHg (n=9); R=155+/-3 mmHg (n=8); 6-OHDA S=151+/-6 mm Hg (n=8); 6-OHDA R=117+/-6 mm Hg. Chemical sympathectomy decreased blood pressure in both S and R rats. There was no indication of sodium accumulation in S rats. Associated with reduced parathyroid hormone levels the S strain had significantly less positive balance for calcium than the R strain, primarily due to increased urinary excretion. A less positive balance for magnesium was also observed, due mainly to relatively reduced intestinal absorption of the ion. We conclude that the HSLK diet is associated with inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased arterial pressure in both strains. In addition, since divalent cations may influence blood pressure, we suggest that the observed abnormalities in calcium and magnesium metabolism might independently promote hypertension development in the S strain.

Photorepair strongly recovers RNA synthesis in wild-type CHO cell line, although the resumption of transcription is decreased in XPB deficient cells. This recovery is accompanied by the prevention of cells entering into apoptosis.

Surgical shunt between the portal and systemic venous systems is considered a definitive solution for that problem. We present our experience with the porto-systemic shunt for extrahepatic portal hypertension. Nine children (mean age 11.4 years) with portal hypertension were referred for a shunt procedure during a 5-year period (1996-2001). We reviewed patients charts for clinical parameters before and after surgery as well as surgical data (type of shunt, portal pressure gradient). A mesocaval shunt was constructed in 5 children, a splenorenal shunt in 3 other children and one child with splenic vein thrombosis underwent splenectomy alone for presumed diagnosis of left sided portal hypertension. During a mean follow-up period of 21.2 months (range 6-63 months), the surgical shunt remained patent in 7 of the 8 children. An immediate drop in portal pressure and increased platelets count over time was noted in those 7 children. In two children high portal pressure persisted after surgery, including a child who underwent mesocaval shunt following a previous failed splenorenal shunt and another child who underwent splenectomy alone. None of the children bled following the shunt procedure and decreased splenic size was observed in the 3 children with massive splenomegaly. We suggest that the porto-systemic shunt is indicated for children with non-hepatic portal hypertension suffering with uncontrolled bleeding and those with massive splenomegaly associated with hypersplenism.

The effects of pharmacological treatment and professional care and support may improve when dementia is detected in an early stage. Furthermore, the patient (and his family) can prepare themselves for the period to come. Health care workers recognize moral problems and tensions concerning early detection that are related to the question whether persons will benefit from knowledge in an earlier stage of dementia, because this knowledge can be a heavy burden. We asked general practitioners, home care workers, employees of the so-called ''Memory clinic'' and specialists, what ethical intuitions they recognize in practice. They mentioned the following questions: when are health care professionals allowed to take initiative, is causing worries and concerns problematic, and should a diagnosis always to be told? We conclude after a first analysis that many moral questions derive from the fact that many health care professionals lack knowledge of the wishes and interests of the elderly. At the same time they try to justify their actions on the (presupposed) consent of the elderly person. We suggest that the general norm ''only act when the patient wants to be helped'' in health care should also apply to detection of dementia, although it should not be taken too strictly. Another justification for early detection can be found in the benefits for the elderly people, when their wishes are no longer expressed.

The gonadal cells, including PGC, were then frozen in 1 of the following cryoprotectant treatments: 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 5% DMSO, 10% DMSO, 2.5% ethylene glycol (EG), 5% EG, 10% EG, and 0% cryoprotectant as a control. The cells were liberated and frozen in a biosecure cryopreservation straw at a rate of -1 degrees C/min until reaching -85 degrees C and were then plunged into liquid N (-196 degrees C), in which they were stored until analysis. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the PGC post-thaw. The PGC marker stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, which was detected with goat antimouse IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used to label all PGC, and propidium iodide was used to detect cells with compromised cell membranes. There was an interaction effect for the number of viable PGC per individual embryo (P < or = 0.05). The highest level (183.6 +/- 28.4) of viable PGC per individual embryo was observed for 10% EG with 10E and was significantly higher (P < or = 0.05) than cryopreservation in 2.5% DMSO with 10E and 20 embryos, 2.5% EG with 10E, 5% EG with 10E, and all 0% cryoprotectant treatments. No statistical interaction (P > 0.05) was observed for the percentage of viable PGC. However, the highest percentage (80.6%) was observed at 10% EG with 10E. It was demonstrated that PGC were successfully frozen, and the most effective treatment was 10% EG with 10 embryos/straw.

(Labiatae), a popular Western and Chinese herbal medicine, has long been associated with anti-viral and anti-bacterial effects. While its anti-viral effects are attributed mainly to the inhibition of virus replication, the biological mechanisms of its anti-bacterial effects remain unknown. As a biological response modifier (BRM), the polysaccharides isolated from P. vulgaris have been shown to up-regulate the immune responses of monocytes/macrophages. However, the immune stimulatory effects seem to contradict its well-known anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that the anti-microbial effects exhibited by the polysaccharides isolated from P. vulgaris encompass both anti-inflammatory and immune stimulatory effects. One of the polysaccharide fractions PV2IV markedly stimulated the production of superoxide and nitrite representing nitric oxide from murine macrophage RAW264.7 and brain macrophage BV2 cells. The amount of nitrite and superoxide produced after PV2IV stimulation was as high as that stimulated by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, PV2IV also increased cellular protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and mRNA for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Similar to the effects of a high dose of LPS, the fraction PV2 could trigger activation-induced cell death (AICD) by stimulating caspase-3 activity and reduction of MTT uptake in monocytes/macrophages. These results may help our understanding of the molecular mechanism of P. vulgaris, which exhibited both immune stimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects against microbial invasion.

Corneal allograft survival was also assessed after anti-VLA-1 antibody treatment and in VLA-1 knockout recipient mice. Anti-VLA-1 antibody treatment leads to a profound reduction in the granulocytic, monocytic, and T-cell infiltration after corneal transplantation. In addition, corneal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were both significantly suppressed in VLA-1 knockout mice. Remarkably, universal graft survival was observed in both anti-VLA-1 antibody treatment and knockout mice. Very late antigen 1 blockade markedly reduces inflammation and inflammation-induced tissue responses, including vasculogenic responses, associated with corneal transplantation and promotes allograft survival.

Transplantation of OPCs is an attractive therapy for demyelinating diseases. However, due to their bipotential differentiation potential, the majority of OPCs differentiate into astrocytes at transplanted sites. It is therefore important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transition from OPCs to oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. In this study, we isolated OPCs from the spinal cords of rat embryos (16 days old) and induced them to differentiate into oligodendrocytes or type II astrocytes in the absence or presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. RNAs were extracted from each cell population and hybridized to GeneChip with 28,700 rat genes. Using the criterion of fold change > 4 in the expression level, we identified 83 genes that were up-regulated and 89 genes that were down-regulated in oligodendrocytes, and 92 genes that were up-regulated and 86 that were down-regulated in type II astrocytes compared with OPCs. The up-regulated genes, such as activating transcription factor 3 and myelin basic protein in oligodendrocytes or claudin 11 in type II astrocytes, might contribute to OPC differentiation and represent constitutive components of oligodendrocytes or type II astrocytes. The down-regulated genes in both oligodendrocytes and type II astrocytes, such as transcription factor 19, might be involved in maintaining self-renewal and/or represent the property of OPCs. These results provide new insights into the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms, by which OPCs differentiate to oligodendrocytes or type II astrocytes.

Methodology/Principal Findings  We used separation by gel electrophoresis followed by hybridization to cDNA microarrays to measure 8,774 mRNA transcript lengths representing at least 6,238 genes at high (>90%) confidence. By comparing these transcript lengths to the Refseq and H-Invitational full-length cDNA databases, we found that nearly half of our measurements appeared to represent novel transcript variants. Comparison of length measurements determined by hybridization to different cDNAs derived from the same gene identified clones that potentially correspond to alternative transcript variants. We observed a close linear relationship between ORF and mRNA lengths in human mRNAs, identical in form to the relationship we had previously identified in yeast. Some functional classes of protein are encoded by mRNAs whose untranslated regions (UTRs) tend to be longer or shorter than average; these functional classes were similar in both human and yeast. Conclusions/Significance  Human transcript diversity is extensive and largely unannotated. Our length dataset can be used as a new criterion for judging the completeness of cDNAs and annotating mRNA sequences. Similar relationships between the lengths of the UTRs in human and yeast mRNAs and the functions of the proteins they encode suggest that UTR sequences serve an important regulatory role among eukaryotes.', '1132/NCBITaxon:9606', '1136/efo:EFO_0002768'

Genomic clustering, predicted functional similarities, and a common pattern of dysregulation in both vhl-1 worms and a set of mutants (dpy-18, let-268, gon-1, mig-17 and unc-6), with different defects in extracellular matrix formation, suggest that dysregulation of these genes reflects a discrete HIF-1 independent function of VHL-1 that is connected with extracellular matrix function.', '1132/NCBITaxon:6239', '1136/efo:EFO_0002768'

We used DNA microarrays to perform a comprehensive analysis of calcineurin/Crz1p-dependent gene expression following addition of Ca2+ (200 mM) or Na+ (0.8 M) to yeast. 163 genes exhibited increased expression that was reduced 50% or more by calcineurin inhibition. These calcineurin dependent genes function in signaling pathways, ion/small molecule transport, cell wall maintenance, vesicular transport, and include many open reading frames of heretofore-unknown function. Three distinct gene classes were defined: 28 genes displayed calcineurin-dependent induction in response to Ca2+ and Na+, 125 showed calcineurin-dependent expression following Ca2+ but not Na+ addition, and 10 were regulated by calcineurin in response to Na+ but not Ca2+. Analysis of crz1D cells established Crz1p as the major effecter of calcineurin-regulated gene expression in yeast. We identified the Crz1p binding site as 5-GNGGC(G/T)CA-3 by in vitro site selection. A similar sequence, 5-GAGGCTG-3, was identified as a common sequence motif in the upstream regions of calcineurin/Crz1p-dependent genes.

The inactivation of multiple pathways that positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization. To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner, we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of 20,000 genes in human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) passaged to senescence. These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the human Papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein. Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative, differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components. A comparison of genes transcriptionally up-regulated in senescence to those in which expression is significantly down-regulated in immortalized HPECs identified three genes: the chemokine BRAK, DOC1, and a member of the insulin-like growth factor axis, IGFBP-3. Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts, and previously, their inactivation was documented in tumor samples. Thus, these genes may function in novel pathways that regulate senescence and are inactivated during immortalization.

We have characterized four alleles with single residue changes in the FATC domain. Of these tra1-L3733A had the most pronounced effects with phenotypes including temperature and cold sensitivity, and reduced growth in media containing ethanol, Calcofluor white, rapamycin, chloramphenicol and geneticin. Tra1-L3733A interacted at normal levels with components of the NuA4 and SAGA complexes, and did not significantly alter histone acetylation patterns. The tra1-L3733A allele resulted in two-fold or greater change in expression of approximately 11% of yeast genes in rich media. Of the 279 genes with increased expression, 175 were ribosomal subunits or involved in ribosomal function or biogenesis. Elevated levels of Pol I and Pol III transcripts were also observed. The phenotypes of the tra1-L3733A overlapped with but were not identical to strains containing deletions of SAGA or NuA4 components or with strains containing mutations in the PI3K domain. Our finding that the double mutant allele, tra1-SRR3413/L3733A with alterations in the PI3K and FATC domains, resulted in wild type growth, suggests a model whereby the FATC domain negatively regulates the activity of the PI3K domain. Expression of genes involved in ribosome biosynthesis, other than the ribosomal subunits themselves, returned to near normal levels in the double mutant strain.  We also characterized tra1-G3745, which contains an additional glycine residue following the normal C-terminal phenylalanine. This allele did not support viability and showed severe dominant negative effects. In contrast to what was observed for tra1-L3733A, tra1-G4745 resulted in decreased expression of genes required for ribosome biogenesis and did not interact with Esa1 or Spt7.

The objective of this study was to search for new genes involved in mouse palate formation. Gene expression of murine embryonic palatal tissue was analyzed at the various developmental stages before, during, and after palate fusion using GeneChip? microarrays. Ceacam1 was one of the highly up-regulated genes during and after fusion in palate formation, and this was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CEACAM1 was expressed at a very low level in palatal epithelium before fusion, but highly expressed in the midline of the palate during and after fusion. To investigate the developmental role of CEACAM1, function-blocking antibody was added to embryonic mouse palate in organ culture. Palatal fusion was inhibited by this function-blocking antibody. To investigate the subsequent  developmental role of CEACAM1, we characterized Ceacam1-deficient (Ceacam1-/-) mice. Epithelial cells persisted abnormally at the midline of the embryonic palate even on day E16.0, and palatal fusion was delayed in Ceacam1-/- mice. TGF?3 expression, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in palatal epithelium were not effected in the palate of Ceacam1-/-mice. CEACAM1 expression was down-regulated in Tgfb3-/- palate. However, exogenous TGF?3 did not induce CEACAM1 expression.

We observed a multitude of differentially expressed genes, e.g., PASD1, ANXA3, NTS or PLAT, when comparing resistant to in vivo passaged tumor samples. Furthermore, tumor cells from in vivo and in vitro conditions showed a significant difference in target gene expression. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional pathways like axon guidance, steroid biosynthesis and complement and coagulation cascades. Most of the genes were involved in anti-coagulation, indicating its possible importance. Upregulation of anti-coagulatory ANXA3 and PLAT and downregulation of PLAT inhibitor SERPINA were validated by qPCR. In contrast, coagulation factor F3 was upregulated, accompanied by the expression of an altered gene product. These findings give insights into the resistance mechanisms of metronomical CPA treatment suggesting an important role of anti-coagulation in resistance formation. 4 cell lines * 2 treatments * 4 replicates = 32 arrays.

In lower vertebrates, computational CGI predictions often reside away from gene promoters, suggesting a major divergence in gene promoter architecture across vertebrates. By experimentally identifying non-methylated DNA in the genomes of seven diverse vertebrates, we instead reveal that non-methylated islands (NMIs) of DNA are a central feature of vertebrate gene promoters. Furthermore, NMIs are present at orthologous genes across vast evolutionary distances, revealing a surprising level of conservation in this epigenetic feature. By profiling NMIs in different tissues and developmental stages we uncover a unifying set of features that are central to the function of NMIs in vertebrates.  Together these findings demonstrate an ancient logic for NMI usage at gene promoters and reveal an unprecedented level of epigenetic conservation across vertebrate evolution.

However, it remains unclear whether different levels of canonical Wnt signaling exert distinct roles in the colonic epithelium. In the present study, we first showed that the canonical Wnt signaling is active in the proliferative compartment of normal colonic crypts by separating actively proliferating progenitor cells from non-proliferating cells in the colon using transgenic mice expressing a histone H2B-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein under the control of a tetracycline responsive regulatory element. Subsequently, we investigated the dose-dependent effect of canonical Wnt activation on colonic epithelial differentiation by controlling the expression levels of stabilized ?-catenin using a doxycycline-inducible transgenic system in mice. We show that elevated levels of Wnt signaling induce the amplification of Lgr5+ cells, which is accompanied by crypt fission and a reduction in cell proliferation among progenitor cells. In contrast, lower levels of ?-catenin induction enhanced cell proliferation rates of epithelial progenitors without affecting crypt fission rates. Notably, slow-cycling cells produced by ?-catenin activation exhibit activation of Notch signaling and the treatment of ?-catenin expressing mice with a Notch inhibitor turned such slow-cycling cells into actively proliferating cells. Our results indicate that the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is sufficient for de novo crypt formation, and suggest that different levels of canonical Wnt activations, in cooperation with Notch signaling, establish a hierarchy of slower-cycling stem cells and faster-cycling progenitor cells characteristic for the colonic epithelium. To separate actively proliferating cells from non-proliferating cells in normal colon, we used transgenic mice expressing a histone H2B-GFP fusion protein under the control of a tetracycline responsive regulatory element (H2B-GFP mice). In H2B-GFP mice, all colonic crypt cells exhibited strong nuclear GFP signal 7 days after doxycycline administration. When doxycycline was withdrawn for 2 days after the labeling period, nuclear GFP signal was diluted in proliferating cells whereas non-proliferating cells retained GFP. GFPhigh non-proliferating and GFPlow proliferating epithelial cells were sorted from the isolated crypts by FACS for microarray analysis. In addition, to investigate the effects of acute Wnt activation in colon, we generated doxycycline-inducible ?-catenin mice. Colonic crypts were isolated from untreated mice and mice fed doxycycline in the drinking water (2.0 mg/ml) for 5 days and subjected to microarray analysis.', '1132/NCBITaxon:10090', '1136/efo:EFO_0002768'

To better understand how genomic alterations of NKX2-1 drive tumorigenesis, we generated an expression signature associated with NKX2-1 amplification in human lung adenocarcinoma, and analyzed DNA binding sites of NKX2-1 by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation from NKX2-1-amplified human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.

RNA interference analysis of NKX2-1-amplified cells compared to non-amplified cells demonstrated that LMO3 mediates cell proliferation downstream of NKX2-1; cistromic analysis that NKX2-1 may cooperate with FOXA1.

Whereas the bud stage tooth developmental arrest in Msx1-/- mutant mice was accompanied by reduction in mesenchymal Bmp4 mRNA expression, we show that depleting functional Bmp4 mRNAs in the tooth mesenchyme, through neural crest-specific gene inactivation in Bmp4f/f;Wnt1Cre mice, caused mandibular molar developmental arrest at the bud stage but allowed maxillary molars and incisors to develop to mineralized teeth. We show that the Wnt inhibitors Dkk2 and Wif1 were much more abundantly expressed in the mandibular than maxillary molar mesenchyme in wildtype embryos and that Dkk2 expression was significantly unregulated in the tooth mesenchyme in Bmp4f/f;Wnt1Cre embryos. In addition, expression of Osr2, which encodes a zinc finger protein that antagonizes Msx1-mediated activation of odontogenic mesenchyme, is significantly upregulated in the molar mesenchyme in Bmp4f/f;Wnt1Cre embryos. Msx1 heterozygosity enhanced maxillary molar developmental defects whereas Osr2 heterozygosity rescued mandibular first molar morphogenesis in Bmp4f/f;Wnt1Cre mice. Moreover, in contrast to complete lack of supernumerary tooth initiation in Msx1-/-Osr2-/- mutant mice, Osr2-/-Bmp4f/f;Wnt1Cre compound mutant mice exhibit formation and subsequent arrest of supernumerary tooth germs that correlated with down regulation of Msx1 expression in the tooth mesenchyme. Taken together, our data indicate that, while reduction in mesenchymal Bmp4 expression alone could not account for the tooth bud arrest phenotype in Msx1-/- mutant mice, Bmp4 signaling synergizes with Msx1 and antagonizes Osr2 to activate mesenchymal odontogenic activity to drive tooth morphogenesis and sequential tooth formation.

It has since become clear that lincRNAs constitute an important layer of genome regulation across a wide spectrum of species. Yet, the factors governing their evolution and origins remain relatively unexplored. One possible factor that may have shaped lincRNA biology are transposable elements (TEs). Here we set out to comprehensively characterize the TE content of lincRNAs relative to genomic averages and protein coding transcripts. Our analysis of the TE composition across 9241 human lincRNAs revealed that, in sharp contrast to protein coding genes, a striking majority (83%) of lincRNAs contain a TE, and TEs comprise 42% of lincRNA transcript sequences. LincRNA TE composition varies significantly from genomic averages, being depleted of LI and Alu elements and enriched for a broad class of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Furthermore, specific TE families occur in biased positions and orientations within lincRNAs, particularly at their transcription start sites, suggesting a role in the origin of those lincRNAs. Finally, we find that TEs can drive gene expression regulation of lincRNAswe observed a dramatic correlation between lincRNAs containing HERVH elements and almost exclusive expression in pluripotent cells. Conversely, those lincRNAs that are devoid of TEs are more highly expressed in testis. Collectively, TEs pervade lincRNAs and have shaped lincRNA evolution and function via bestowing tissue-specific expression from donated transcriptional regulatory signals. We extracted profiled the transcriptome expression polyadenylated mRNA-Seq.  We then used these to reconstruct the transcriptome using de-novo assemblers and identify long non coding RNAs and their expression.', '1132/NCBITaxon:9606', '1136/efo:EFO_0003738'

SCD1 inhibition in hPSCs induced ER stress, protein synthesis attenuation, and apoptosis of these cells, revealing that MUFA biosynthesis is crucial for their survival.

Hepatitis C cirrhosis-related HCC is the most rapidly increasing cause of cancer death in the US. Non-invasive methods have been developed to identify patients with asymptomatic, early-stage cirrhosis, increasing the burden of HCC surveillance, but biomarkers are needed to identify patients with cirrhosis who are most in need of surveillance. We investigated whether a liver-derived 186-gene signature previously associated with outcomes of patients with HCC is prognostic for patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis but without HCC.  Methods: We performed gene expression profile analysis of formalin-fixed needle biopsies from the livers of 216 patients with hepatitis C-related early-stage (Child-Pugh class A) cirrhosis who were prospectively followed for a median of 10 years at an Italian center. We evaluated whether the 186-gene signature was associated with death, progression of cirrhosis, and development of HCC.  Results: Fifty-five (25%), 101 (47%), and 60 (28%) patients were classified as having poor-, intermediate-, and good-prognosis signatures, respectively. In multivariable Cox regression modeling, the poor-prognosis signature was significantly associated with death (P=.004), progression to advanced cirrhosis (P<.001), and development of HCC (P=.009). The 10-year rates of survival were 63%, 74%, and 85% and the annual incidences of HCC were 5.8%, 2.2%, and 1.5% for patients with poor-, intermediate-, and good-prognosis signatures, respectively.   Conclusions: A 186-gene signature used to predict outcomes of patients with HCC is also associated with outcomes of patients with hepatitis C-related early-stage cirrhosis. This signature might be used to identify patients with cirrhosis in most need of surveillance and strategies to prevent their development of HCC. 216 liver biopsy specimens', '1132/NCBITaxon:9606', '1136/efo:EFO_0002768'

As the interest in determination of disease methylation profiles increases, the scope, advantages and limitations of these methods requires assessment. There are key questions to answer and specific challenges to overcome. For example, how much detail/resolution is sufficient to identify regions of differential methylation and regions of biological/medical significance within a sample? How much coverage of the genome is required for accurate methylation analysis? Is it important to confirm which regions of the genome are unmethylated in addition to focusing on those that are methylated? Loss of methylation may be of equal importance within the cell since this may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. A multi-method (affinity enrichment/bisulphite-conversion based/direct sequencing of methyl-cytosine) and technology platform (Illumina HiSeq/PacBio/Illumina Infinium BeadChip) comparison will enable us to determine the strengths and weakness of each method.

Functional investigations demonstrate that the stalling of mRNA precursors on spliceosomes is required for siRNA accumulation. Lariat debranching enzyme is also necessary for siRNA production, suggesting a requirement for processing of stalled splicing intermediates. We propose that recognition of mRNA precursors by the SCANR complex is in kinetic competition with splicing, thereby promoting siRNA production from transposon transcripts stalled on spliceosomes. Disparity in the strength of gene expression signals encoded by transposons versus genes offers an avenue for the evolution of genome defense.

Regardless of location, they are characterized by loss of functional SMARCB1 protein, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The aim of this study was to determine genes and biological process dysregulated in common to both AT/RTs and KRTs. Gene expression for AT/RTs was compared to that of other brain tumors and normal brain using microarray data from our lab. Similar analysis was performed for KRTs and other kidney tumors and normal kidney using data from GEO. Dysregulated genes common to both analyses were analyzed for functional significance. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of RTs identified 3 major subsets: 2 comprised of AT/RTs, and 1 of KRTs. Compared to other tumors, 1187, 663 and 539 genes were dysregulated in each subset, respectively. Only 14 dysregulated genes were common to all 3 subsets. Compared to normal tissue, 5209, 4275 and 2841 genes were dysregulated in each subset, with an overlap of 610 dysregulated genes. Among these genes, processes associated with cell proliferation, MYC activation, and epigenetic dysregulation were common to all 3 RT subsets. The low overlap of dysregulated genes in AT/RTs and KRTs suggests that factors in addition to SMARCB1 loss play a role in determining subsequent gene expression. Drugs which target cell cycle or epigenetic genes may be useful in all RTs. Additionally, targeted therapies tailored to specific RT subset molecular profiles should be considered.   Molecular profiling of 20 ATRTs, 42 other pediatric CNS WHO Grade IV tumor samples and 9 pediatric normal brain samples was performed using Affymetrix U133 Plus2 GeneChips. Data were background corrected and normalized using gcRMA (as implemented in Bioconductor). ANOVA was used to identify differentially expressed genes for AT/RTs compared to other brain tumor types. Various analyses, including bioinformatics tools DAVID, Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA), and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis,  were used to identify biological processes and genes of particular interest among the  differentially expressed genes. Similar analysis of publicly available KRT and pediatric kidney tumor  and normal kidney data was also performed by us.

For clinical applications, a quality-controlled, xenobiotic-free culture system is required to minimize risks from contaminating animal-derived pathogens and immunogens. We previously reported that the pericellular matrix of decidua-derived mesenchymal cells (PCM-DM) is an ideal human-derived substrate on which to maintain hiPSCs/hESCs. In this study, we examined whether PCM-DM could be used for the generation and long-term stable maintenance of hiPSCs. Decidua-derived mesenchymal cells (DMCs) were reprogrammed by the retroviral transduction of four factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC) and cultured on PCM-DM. The established hiPSC clones expressed alkaline phosphatase, hESC-specific genes and cell-surface markers, and differentiated into three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. At over 20 passages, the hiPSCs cultured on PCM-DM held the same cellular properties with genome integrity as those at early passages. Global gene expression analysis showed that the GDF3, FGF4, UTF1, and XIST expression levels varied during culture, and GATA6 was highly expressed under our culture conditions; however, these gene expressions did not affect the cells pluripotency. PCM-DM can be conveniently prepared from DMCs, which have a high proliferative potential. Our findings indicate that PCM-DM is a versatile and practical human-derived substrate that can be used for the feeder-cell-free generation and long-term stable maintenance of hiPSCs.

IL-27 is an anti-HIV cytokine that also modulates monocyte activation. Here, we present new evidence that IL-27 promotes monocyte differentiation into macrophages that are non-permissive for HIV-1 infection. While IL-27 treatment does not affect expression of macrophage differentiation markers or macrophage biological functions, it confers HIV resistance by down-regulating spectrin beta non-erythrocyte 1 (SPTBN1), a required host factor for HIV-1 infection. IL-27 down-regulates SPTBN1 through a TAK-1-mediated MAPK signaling pathway. Knockdown of SPTBN1 strongly inhibits HIV-1 infection of macrophages; conversely, overexpression of SPTBN1 markedly increases HIV susceptibility of IL-27 treated macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrate that SPTBN1 associates with HIV-1 gag proteins. Collectively, our results underscore the ability of   IL-27 to protect macrophages from HIV-1 infection by down-regulating SPTBN1, thus indicating that SPTBN1 is an important host target to reduce HIV-1 replication in one major element of the viral reservoir. 2 samples with different treatments were analyzed.

The potential clinical applicability of these findings is based on the minimal regenerative potential of the adult human heart and the limited availability of human heart tissue.  An initial, but mandatory step toward clinical application of this approach is to establish conditions for conversion of adult human fibroblasts to a cardiac phenotype.  Toward this goal, we sought to determine the optimal combination of factors necessary and sufficient for direct myocardial reprogramming of human fibroblasts.  Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including Gata4, Hand2, Tbx5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts.  After maintenance in culture for 4-11 weeks, human fibroblasts reprogrammed with these proteins and microRNAs displayed sarcomere-like structures and calcium transients, and a small subset of such cells exhibited spontaneous contractility.  These phenotypic changes were accompanied by expression of a broad range of cardiac genes and suppression of non-myocyte genes.  These findings indicate that human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiac-like myocytes by forced expression of cardiac transcription factors with muscle-specific microRNAs and represent a step toward possible therapeutic application of this reprogramming approach. Human foreskin fibroblasts were transduced with 5 transcription factors and total RNA was obtained 4 weeks later.  total RNA was also obtained from human foreskin fibroblasts as a negative control and adult human heart tissue as a positive control.

Feeding, energy expenditure, and insulin sensitivity were identical in LG2KO and control mice. Glucose tolerance was normal early after Glut2 inactivation but intolerance developed at later time. This was caused by progressive impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion even though beta-cell mass and insulin content remained normal. Liver transcript profiling revealed a coordinate down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in LG2KO mice. This was associated with reduced hepatic cholesterol in fasted mice and a 30 percent reduction in bile acid production. We showed that chronic bile acids or FXR agonist treatment of primary islets increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, an effect not seen in islets from fxr-/- mice.

First, we investigated the feasibility to obtain RNA from whole endobronchial biopsies suitable for RNA-Seq. Second, we examined the difference in transcriptomic profiles between asthma and controls. Methods: This cross-sectional study compared 4 steroid-free atopic asthma patients and 5 healthy non-atopic controls.  RNA of ASM from 4 endobronchial biopsies per subject was isolated and sequenced (GS FLX+, 454/Roche). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify gene networks. Comparison of the numbers of reads per gene in asthma and controls was based on the Poisson distribution. At the current sample size the estimated false discovery rate was 4%. Results: Yield of isolated RNA was 900-9,300ng. We identified 10,167 and 11,006 unique genes for asthma and controls, respectively.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to correlate with therapy resistance, but the functional link and signaling pathways remain to be elucidated. We report here that miR-30c, a human breast tumor prognostic marker, plays a pivotal role in chemo-resistance by a direct targeting of the actin-transporter TWF1, which promotes EMT. An IL-6 family member, IL-11 was identified as a secondary target of TWF1 in the miR-30c signaling pathway. Expression of miR-30c inversely correlated with IL-11 expression in clinical tumors and IL-11 correlated with relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients.

Analysis of 18 of these genes in a cohort of 224 chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML), which is the most frequent MPN/MDS, identified at least one mutated gene in 95% of the patients, with some of the mutations affecting the disease phenotype. The number of mutated genes negatively affected progression-free and overall survival in multivariate analysis. Analysis of sorted progenitors indicated an early amplification of the CMML clone at the CD34+/CD38- stage of hematopoiesis, together with a premature granulomonocytic differentiation skewing. We interrogated the clone architecture by mutation-specific discrimination analysis of single-cell-derived colonies. The genetic classification of individual colonies allowed a designation of sub-clones and the assembly of putative evolutionary trees, indicating a linear acquisition of the studied mutations. Analysis of matched pre- and post-treatment samples demonstrated clonal persistence with limited and selective elimination of sub-clones. The disease was characterized by an amplification of multipotent and common myeloid progenitors in the CD34+ compartment, both fractions showing increased granulomonocytic differentiation at the expense of erythroid progenitors, contrasting with normal granulomonocytic progenitors. Altogether, early amplification of the leukemic clone and increased granulomonocytic differentiation of early progenitors may account for the specificity of CMML among myeloid neoplasms.

Here we have addressed the relevance of GDNF-RET signaling in response to aromatase inhibitor treatment and explored the efficacy of using RET inhibitors in breast cancer models of aromatase inhibitor response and resistance. A GDNF-response gene set, identified from gene expression profiling, was demonstrated to be an independent prognostic marker of poor patient outcome and, importantly, to be predictive of poor response to aromatase inhibitor treatment and development of resistance. The relevance of these findings was validated first by demonstrating an association of RET protein expression in an independent cohort of aromatase inhibitor resistant patient samples. Second, in in vitro models, GDNF-mediated RET signaling was demonstrated to enhance the survival of aromatase inhibitor resistant cells and to increase resistance in aromatase inhibitor sensitive cells. These effects could be reversed by targeting GDNF/RET signaling with the RET selective inhibitor NVP-BBT594 thus identifying GDNF-RET signaling as a potential therapeutic target, particularly in breast cancers resistant to aromatase inhibitors.MCF7 cells were E2-deprived by culturing in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% DCC for 3 days and then serum-starved overnight in the presence or absence of fulvestrant (ICI182,780) (100 nM).

Transgenerational inheritance requires the germline transmission of altered epigenetic information between generations in the absence of direct environmental exposures. The primary periods for epigenetic programming of the germline is associated with primordial germ cell development and during fetal gonadal sex determination. The current study examined the actions of an agricultural fungicide vinclozolin on gestating female (F0 generation) progeny in regards to the primordial germ cell (PGC) epigenetic reprogramming of the F3 generation (i.e. great-grandchildren). The F3 generation primordial germ cell transcriptome and epigenome (DNA methylation) was altered transgenerationally. Interestingly, the differential DNA methylation regions (DMR) and altered transcriptomes were distinct between the onset of gonadal sex determination at embryonic day 13 (E13) and after cord formation in the testis at embryonic day 16 (E16). A larger number of DMR and transcriptional alterations were observed in the E13 PGC than E16 germ cells. Observations demonstrate an altered transgenerational epigenetic reprogramming and function of the primordial germ cells and subsequent male germline is a component of vinclozolin induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. Insights into the molecular control of germline transmitted epigenetic inheritance are provided. The combined observations demonstrate ancestral exposure of a gestating female during fetal gonadal sex determination can promote transgenerational alterations in the primordial germ cell and subsequent male germline epigenetic and transcriptional programming. This altered germline programming leads to the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and phenotypic variation. Observations support the role of the primordial germ cell programming in the molecular mechanism involved and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomena. Results suggest a cascade of epigenetic and transcriptional events during germ cell development is needed to obtain the mature germline epigenome that is then transmitted transgenerationally.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA replication takes place on chromatin. This poses the critical question as to how DNA replication can progress through chromatin, which is inhibitory to all DNA-dependent processes. Here, we have developed a novel genome-wide method to measure chromatin accessibility to micrococcal nuclease that is normalized for nucleosome density, NCAM (Normalized Chromatin Accessibility to MNase) assay.  This method enabled us to discover that chromatin accessibility increases specifically at and ahead of DNA replication forks in normal S phase and during replication stress.   We further found that Mec1, a key regulatory ATR-like kinase in the S-phase checkpoint, is required for both normal chromatin accessibility around replication forks and replication fork rate during replication stress. In this study we sought to analyze the chromatin structural changes that take place at sites of DNA replication. To this end, we obtained yeast cell populations synchronously undergoing DNA replication by ?-factor G1 arrest and release. In order to analyze chromatin structure at sites of DNA replication we first mapped the genomic locations undergoing DNA replication to high-resolution, strand-specific microarrays tiling chromosomes III, VI, and XII, covering ~14% of the genome. Two complementary approaches were taken: (1) we mapped fork positions by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of a FLAG-tagged DNA polymerase 1 (Pol1), a replication fork component and (2) we mapped the sites of active DNA synthesis by generating DNA copy number profiles. We then analyzed chromatin structure at the sites of DNA replication by Micrococcal nuclease mononucleosome mapping and by generating histone H3 density maps. We further generated a Normalized Chromatin Accessibility to MNase (NCAM) signal by normalizing MNase mononucleosome signal for histone H3 density. NCAM signal represents a measure of nucleosome accessibility to MNase that is normalized for nucleosome content. These three approaches allowed us to assess potential changes in nucleosome positioning, nucleosome density, and nucleosome accessibility during DNA replication. We searched for changes in chromatin structure by comparing, during S phase, regions undergoing DNA replication to those not yet replicated, and also by comparing the same region before replication (not replicated, G1 arrested control) and during DNA replication in S phase. We typically harvested S phase cells at 30 or 60 minutes after release from G1 arrest. Experimental conditions included releasing cells into rich media at 24°C or into rich media containing 200 mM Hydroxyurea (HU). Both conditions slowed down replication fork rate and made these experiments feasible. For each strain, samples for the different experiments (Chromatin for Pol1 and H3 ChIP, in vivo MNase digestion, and DNA for DNA copy number profiles) were harvested simultaneously for each time point. Therefore, comparisons between time points for each strain must be made using samples from the same replicate experiment.

The lack of productive infection of neurons by HIV suggests that viral and cellular proteins, with neurotoxic activities, released from HIV-1-infected target cells can cause this neuronal deregulation. The viral protein R (Vpr), a protein encoded by HIV-1, has been shown to alter the expression of various important cytokines and inflammatory proteins in infected and uninfected cells; however the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Using a human neuronal cell line, we found that Vpr can be taken up by neurons causing: (i) deregulation of calcium homeostasis, (ii) endoplasmic reticulum-calcium release, (iii) activation of the oxidative stress pathway, (iv) mitochondrial dysfunction and v- synaptic retraction. In search for the cellular factors involved, we performed microRNAs and gene array assays using human neurons (primary cultures or cell line, SH-SY5Y) that we treated with recombinant Vpr proteins. Interestingly, Vpr deregulates the levels of several microRNAs (e.g. miR-34a) and their target genes (e.g. CREB), which could lead to neuronal dysfunctions. Therefore, we conclude that Vpr plays a major role in neuronal dysfunction through deregulating microRNAs and their target genes, a phenomenon that could lead to the development of neurocognitive disorders.

It has been suggested that viral infections and neurological disease outcome may also be shaped by the influence of small RNAs. This has prompted us to suggest that HIV infection alters the endogenous miRNA expression patterns, thereby contributing to neuronal deregulation and AIDS dementia. Therefore, using primary cultures and neuronal cell lines, we examined the impact of a viral protein (HIV-1 Tat) on the expression of miRNAs due to its characteristic features such as release from the infected cells and taken up by noninfected cells. Using microRNA array assay, we demonstrated that Tat deregulates the levels of several miRNAs. Interestingly, miR-34a was among the most highly induced miRNAs in Tat-treated neurons. Tat also decreases the levels of miR-34a target genes such as CREB protein as shown by real time PCR. The effect of Tat was neutralized in the presence of anti-miR-34a. Using in situ hybridization assay, we found that the levels of miR-34a increase in Tat transgenic mice when compared with the parental mice.

Nevertheless, it is an extremely cold-sensitive tropical species. Thus far, there is limited information about gene regulation and signaling pathways related to the cold stress response in cassava. The development of microarray technology has accelerated the study of global transcription profiling under certain conditions.  Results: A 60-mer oligonucleotide 4X44K Agilent microarray representing 20,840 genes was used to perform transcriptome profiling in cassava apical shoots subjected to cold at 7°C for 0 h, 4 h, and 9 h. A total of 508 transcripts were identified as early cold-responsive genes in which 319 sequences had descriptions when they were aligned with Arabidopsis proteins. Gene ontology (GO) annotation analysis identified many interesting categories including Response to abiotic and biotic stimulus, Response to stress, Transcription factor activity, and Chloroplast. Various stress-associated genes comprising signal transduction components (e.g., MAP kinase 4), transcription factors (TFs; e.g., RAP2.11), and ROS scavenging enzymes (e.g., catalase 2), as well as photosynthesis-related genes (e.g., PSAL), were found. Seventeen major TF families were also identified as being involved in the early response to cold stress (e.g., AP2-EREBP). Meanwhile, KEGG pathway analysis uncovered many important pathways, including Plant hormone signal transduction, Starch and sucrose metabolism, and Plant-pathogen interaction. Furthermore, the expression changes of 18 genes under cold and other abiotic stresses conditions were validated by real-time RT-PCR. As a response to cold stress in cassava, an increase in the ROS scavenging enzyme activities of catalase and superoxide dismutases and the accumulation of total soluble sugars were also detected. Importantly, most of the tested stress-responsive genes were primarily expressed in mature leaves, stem cambia, and fibrous roots rather than apical buds and young leaves.  Conclusions: The dynamic expression changes reflect the integrative controlling and transcriptome regulation of the networks in the early cold stress response of cassava. The biological processes involved in the signal perception and physiological response might shed light on the molecular mechanisms related to cold tolerance in tropical plants and provide useful candidate genes for genetic improvement. Apical shoots subjected to cold at 7°C for 0 h, 4 h, and 9 h were collected for RNA extractions from three independent healthy 3-month-old cassava (cultivar TMS60444) plants in the greenhouse.', '1132/NCBITaxon:3983', '1136/efo:EFO_0002768'

It is well established that the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC is regulated by the ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4-2, limiting ENaC cell surface expression and activity. Ubiquitylation can be reversed by the action of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). One such DUB, USP2-45, was identified previously as an aldosterone-induced protein in the kidney, and is also a circadian output gene. In heterologous expression systems USP2-45 binds to ENaC, deubiquitylates it and enhances channel density and activity at the cell surface. Because the role of USP2-45 in renal Na+ transport had not been studied in vivo, we investigated here the effect of Usp2 gene inactivation in this process. We demonstrate first that the USP2-45 protein has a rhythmic expression with a peak at ZT12. Usp2-KO  mice did not show any differences to wild-type littermates with respect to the diurnal control of Na+ or K+ urinary excretion and plasma levels neither on standard diet, nor after acute and chronic changes to low and high Na+ diets, respectively. Moreover, they had similar aldosterone levels either at low or high Na+ diet. Blood pressure measurements using telemetry did not reveal variations as compared to control mice. Usp2-KO did neither display alternations in ENaC or Na+,Cl--cotransporter (NCC) expression, nor were there any changes in regulatory protein levels, as evidenced by immunoblotting and transcriptome analysis. We conclude that USP2-45 is not crucial for the regulation of Na+ balance or maintenance of blood pressure in vivo. We compared gene expression in kidneys from Usp2 Knock-Out versus Wild-Type.

As the predominant glial element in the sensory retina, Muller cells are responsible for the homeostatic and metabolic support of retinal neurons and active players in virtually all forms of retinal injury and disease. Besides, Muller cells span the entire retinal thickness, extending from the inner to the outer limiting membranes, with cell bodies located in the inner nuclear layer and lateral processes expanding into the plexiform layers of the tissue. Because of this unique morphology, Muller cells can sense even minute changes in the retinal structure because of the mechanical stretching of their long processes or side branches. Thus, its reasonable to infer that Muller cells also participate in ocular diseases when the retina is overstretched. In this study, we aim to investigate the whole genome regulation of Muller cells under mechanical stretching, which may help in excluding possible molecular mechanisms that would account for many retinal diseases in which the retina is often subjected to mechanical forces. We used microarrays to identify patterns of gene expression changes induced by cyclic mechanical stretching in Muller cells.

While breeding technologies provide potential to combat negative stress-mediated outcomes over time, interventions which act to prime plant tolerance to stress, via the use of phytohormone-based elicitors for example, could act as a valuable tool for crop protection. However, the translation of fundamental biology into functioning solution is often constrained by knowledge-gaps. Photosynthetic and transcriptomic responses were characterised in young tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seedlings in response to pre-treatment with a new plant health activator technology, Alethea, followed by a subsequent 100 mM salinity stress. Salinity treatment led to a maximal 47% reduction in net photosynthetic rate 8 d following NaCl treatment. In Alethea pre-treated seedlings, sensitivity to salinity stress was markedly reduced during the experimental period. Microarray analysis of leaf transcriptional responses showed that while salinity stress and Alethea individually impacted on largely non-overlapping, distinct groups of genes, Alethea pre-treatment substantially modified the response to salinity. Alethea affected the expression of genes related to biotic stress, ethylene signalling, cell wall synthesis, redox signalling and photosynthetic processes.  Since Alethea had clear effects on photosynthesis/chloroplastic function at the physiological and molecular levels, we also investigated the ability of Alethea to protect plants against methyl viologen, a potent generator of oxidative stress in chloroplasts. Alethea pre-treatment produced dramatic reductions in visible foliar necrosis caused by methyl viologen compared with non-primed controls. Tomato leaves from four groups of treated plants were harvested at a single point following treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Plants came from two initial groups, pre-treated either with water (control) or the Alethea product.

During follicle assembly oocyte nests break down and a layer of pre-granulosa cells surrounds individual oocytes to form primordial follicles.  The pool of primordial follicles formed is the source of oocytes for ovulation during a females reproductive life.  Complex networks of cellular signaling and gene expression are essential for any biological process.  A systems biology experimental approach provides a global view of these gene relationships in a particular developmental process.  The current study utilized a systems approach to detect all genes that are differentially expressed in response to seven different growth factor and hormone treatments known to influence primordial follicle assembly in a neonatal rat ovary culture system.  One novel growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), was experimentally determined to inhibit follicle assembly.  The different growth factor and hormone treatments were all found to affect the same physiological pathways, but each treatment affected a unique set of differentially expressed genes (signature gene set).  A gene bionetwork analysis identified gene modules of coordinately expressed interconnected genes and it was found that different gene modules appear to accomplish distinct tasks during primordial follicle assembly.  Unique gene networks were identified for a number of the modules and signature gene sets. Predictions of physiological pathways important to follicle assembly were validated using ovary culture experiments in which ERK1/2 (MAPK1) activity was increased. A number of the highly interconnected genes in these gene networks have previously been linked to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and polycystic ovarian disease syndrome (PCOS). Observations have identified novel factors and gene networks that regulate primordial follicle assembly. This systems approach has helped elucidate the molecular control of primordial follicle assembly and provided potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ovarian disease.

This S phase established cohesion is, together with DSB recruitment of cohesin and formation of damage induced (DI) cohesion, also important for repair of DSBs. Eco1 is a common essential factor for S phase and DI-cohesion. The fission yeast Eco1ortholog, Eso1, is important both for S phase cohesion and for bypass of UV induced lesions, and is expressed as a fusion protein with Pol?. The cohesion function has been attributed solely to Eso1 and the lesion bypass function to the Pol? part of the protein. As we found the interaction between the two proteins intriguing we decided to look for a functional connection also in budding yeast. Indeed, despite being dispensable for S phase cohesion, budding yeast Pol? is required for formation of DI genome-wide cohesion. However, Pol? deficient cells are DSB repair competent, revealing differential regulation of DI-cohesion at the break and genome-wide. This finding challenges the importance of DI genome-wide cohesion for DSB repair, and based on our findings we suggest that S phase cohesion is not sufficient for correct chromosome segregation in the presence of DNA damage.

Here we present quantitative, genome-wide analysis of 5hmC, 5-  methylcytosine (5mC) and gene expression in differentiated CNS cell types in vivo. We report that  5hmC is enriched in active genes, and that surprisingly strong depletion of 5mC is observed over these  regions.

Expression of HAE and HSL2 is specific to Abscission Zone (AZ) cells and is higher in stage 15 flowers than in earlier developmental stages. By stage 16 floral organs have begun to abscise, suggesting that HAE HSL2 are most active in stage 15 flowers. Samples were enriched for AZ RNA by isolating RNA from flower receptacles, the region from the base of the flower to slightly above the base of attachment of the sepals, petals, and stamen. RNA-seq was then used to analyze and compare the transcriptomes of wild type and hae-3 hsl2-3 mutants. 2034 genes were differentially expressed with a False Discovery Rate adjusted p < 0.05, of which 349 genes 2 fold or greater change.

Canine INS are malignant in >95% of cases. This study aims to provide further insights on molecular pathways involved in INS pathogenesis and to identify prognostic genes. Canine specific cDNA microarray representing 20,313 genes was used to analyze expression profiles in a panel of ten primary INS and ten INS metastases. Eighty-four genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in the group of metastases in comparison to the group of primary INS. From the microarray analysis it also followed that primary INS, based on their gene expression profiles, can be divided into two groups, which differ in their malignancy potential. It was also demonstrated that canine INS have both endocrine and exocrine cell features. Furthermore, the present study has revealed pancreatic lipase and chymotrypsinogen B1 as candidate genes that can be followed up in prospective studies as prognostic markers for INS. Our findings add to the current knowledge of INS pathogenesis and tumor progression, which can be used for future therapeutic and prognostic strategies, for both dogs and humans. From 1993 to 2009, ten histologically confirmed primary insulinomas (INS) and their accompanying metastases were obtained from dogs that were presented at the Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University.

Global transcriptome profiling was used to evaluate if these two habitats offer distinct environments for bacteria and thus present distinct driving forces for adaptation.  Further transcriptome profiling was performed to understand the various environmental conditions that P. syringae cells encounter during their association with plants.   RNA was collected from P. syringae pv. syringae strain B728a cells that were exposed to seven treatments.  The treatments included five in vitro treatments, namely exposing cells to a basal medium, sodium chloride to confer an osmotic stress, hydrogen peroxide to confer an apoplastic growth, iron limitation, nitrogen limitation.  They also included two in planta treatments, namely recovering cells from epiphytic sites after surface inoculation and 72 h of growth on bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaves and recovering cells from apoplastic sites after infiltration and 48 h of growth in bean leaves.  The results suggested that B728a cells experience vastly different environments when growing on the surface versus the interior of leaves and identified distinct traits that are likely used for persistence and growth in these environments. RNA was collected from B728a cells that were exposed to seven treatments, each with two biological replicates in each of three laboratories.  Experimental methods were standardized across the three laboratories.  For the in vitro treatments, exponential cells from two independent cultures were each exposed to the five treatments.  For each treatment, the cells originating from the two cultures were pooled and the RNA was extracted; this was repeated in its entirety and the two RNA pools were combined.  The resulting RNA representing four independent cultures served as a single biological replicate.  Two biological replicates for each treatment were generated in this manner in each of three separate laboratories. Epiphytic B728a populations were established following spray inoculation onto bean leaves and subsequent incubation; the epiphytic cells recovered from 400 to 600 leaves inoculated at one time served as a biological replicate, and the procedure was repeated to provide two biological replicates.  Due to the availability of facilities, all of the epiphytic treatments were conducted at as single laboratory, with cultures provided from each of the other laboratories, and the cell pellets were returned to those laboratories for RNA extraction and analysis. Apoplastic B728a populations were established following vacuum infiltration into bean leaves and subsequent incubation; the apoplastic cells recovered from 40 to 80 leaves inoculated at one time served as a biological replicate, and two biological replicates were generated at each of the three laboratories.

Recent studies indicated that JAG1 is a gene associated with cancer progression. Therefore, we investigated the role of JAG1 in lung cancer progression. Methods: The expression of JAG1 was manipulated by overexpression or RNA silencing in several human lung cell lines. The effect of JAG1 on tumorigenesis and invasion was assessed by the cell anchorage-independent growth, cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion assays in vitro as well as metastasis in vivo. The potential downstream genes of JAG1 were identified by oligonucleotide microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription¡Vpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We further measured JAG1 expression in lung cancer specimens by RT-PCR. Correlation between JAG1 expression and overall survival of lung cancer patients was determined by using the log-rank test and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: JAG1 enhanced anchorage-independent growth, cell migration, invasion in the lower invasive cells, CL1-0. JAG1 also increased the capability of migration and invasion in the other two lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI-H226). The silencing of JAG1 inhibited migration and invasion activities of the higher invasive cells, CL1-5, by siRNA technology. The invasion-promoting activity of JAG1 was also demonstrated in vivo by using a mouse metastasis model. By microarray analysis, we found that the expression of heat shock 70kDa protein 2 (HSPA2) was activated by JAG1 overexpression and eliminated by JAG1 silencing. Moreover, lung cancer patients with high JAG1 expressing tumors had shorter overall survival than those with low-expressing tumors. Conclusion: JAG1 might be an oncogene which promotes colonogenesis and metastasis, and high JAG1 expression is associated with shorten survival in lung cancer. In this investigation, we used a lung cancer invasion cell model to identify the genes involved in cancer progression. JAG1 is a potential oncogene whose expression is correlated to the survival of patients with breast, prostate and liver cancers. However, the role of JAG1 in lung caner progression has not been reported, particularly in metastasis. Here, JAG1 was ectopically expressed in lower invasive lung cancer cell line its impact on colonogenesis, migration and invasiveness was assessed.

Inhibition of HDACs using small molecule inhibitors (HDACi) is a potential strategy in the treatment of various diseases and is approved for treating hematological malignancies. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of HDACi requires knowledge of HDAC-function in vivo. Here, we generated a thymocyte-specific gradient of HDAC-activity using compound conditional knockout mice for Hdac1 and Hdac2. Unexpectedly, gradual loss of HDAC-activity engendered a dosage dependent accumulation of immature thymocytes and correlated with the incidence and latency of monoclonal lymphoblastic thymic lymphomas. Strikingly, complete ablation of Hdac1 and Hdac2 abrogated lymphomagenesis due to a block in early thymic development. Genomic, biochemical and functional analyses of pre-leukemic thymocytes and tumors revealed a critical role for Hdac1/Hdac2-governed HDAC-activity in regulating a p53-dependent barrier to constrain Myc-overexpressing thymocytes from progressing into lymphomas by regulating Myc-collaborating genes.

To address this, we derived and characterized two types of rabbit PSCs from the same breed of New Zealand White rabbits: four lines of embryonic stem cells (rbESCs), and three lines of induced PSCs (rbiPSCs) that resulted from reprogramming adult skin fibroblasts. All lines were dependent on fibroblast growth factor 2. All rbESC lines exhibited molecular and functional properties typically associated with primed pluripotency. The rbESC lines also exhibited a cell cycle with a prolonged G1 phase and a DNA damage checkpoint prior to entry into the S phase, which are two features typically associated with the somatic cell cycle. In contrast, the rbiPSC lines exhibited some characteristics of naïve pluripotency as defined in rodents, including resistance to single cell dissociation by trypsin, robust activity of the distal enhancer of the mouse Oct4 gene, and expression of naïve-specific genes. According to gene expression profiles, rbiPSCs were closer to the rabbit inner cell mass than rbESCs. We propose that rbiPSCs self-renew in an intermediate state between naïve and primed pluripotency, which represents a key step toward the generation of bona fide naïve PSC lines in rabbits The patterns of stage specific embryonic antigen (SSEA) expression were also assessed between cell lines. All two rbiPSC lines exhibited heterogeneous expression of SSEA1 and SSEA4 that leads to obtain 3 different cell sub-populations (SSEA1+, SSEA1+/4+, SSEA1-/4-).

Diagnostic delays and uncertainty lead to treatment delays and inappropriate antibiotic use. A growing literature suggests the hosts inflammatory response to the pathogen represents a potential tool to improve upon current diagnostics. The hypothesis of this study is that the host responds differently to S. aureus than to E. coli infection in a quantifiable way, providing a new diagnostic avenue. This study uses Bayesian sparse factor modeling and penalized binary regression to define peripheral blood gene-expression classifiers of murine and human S. aureus infection. The murine-derived classifier distinguished S. aureus infection from healthy controls and Escherichia coli-infected mice across a range of conditions (mouse and bacterial strain, time post infection) and was validated in outbred mice (AUC>0.97). A S. aureus classifier derived from a cohort of 95 human subjects distinguished S. aureus blood stream infection (BSI) from healthy subjects (AUC 0.99) and E. coli BSI (AUC 0.82). Murine and human responses to S. aureus infection share common biological pathways, allowing the murine model to classify S. aureus BSI in humans (AUC 0.84). Both murine and human S. aureus classifiers were validated in an independent human cohort (AUC 0.95 and 0.94, respectively).  The approach described here lends insight into the conserved and disparate pathways utilized by mice and humans in response to these infections.  Furthermore, this study advances our understanding of S. aureus infection; the host response to it; and identifies new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. To create a host gene expression-based classifier for S. aureus infection, mice from a variety of experimental conditions were utilized.  Seven different strains of inbred mice (n=187 total) were challenged with four different S. aureus strains via intraperitoneal inoculation and sacrificed at various time points as described in Methods.  The comparator group for model derivation included 50 A/J or C57BL/6J mice inoculated with E. coli (O18:K1:H7) as well as 54 uninfected mice. Next, the murine S. aureus classifier was externally validated in outbred CD-1 mice with S. aureus infection (Sanger 476 or USA300), E. coli infection (O18:K1:H7), or uninfected controls (10 animals per condition).

Comparison of circulating and airway T cells from healthy and asthmatic subjects revealed asthma-associated and tissue-specific miRNA expression patterns.

Hsp72 protects from cerebral ischemia, and although several mechanisms of protection have been investigated, effects on astrocyte activation are unknown.  To identify potential mechanisms of protection, gene expression was assessed in mice subjected to middle cerebral artery (MCAO) or sham surgery, of either wildtype (WT) or Hsp72-overexpressing (Hsp72Tg) mice. After stroke, both genotypes exhibited genes related to cell death, stress response, and immune response.  Furthermore, genes indicative of astrocyte activation, including cytoskeletal proteins and cytokines, were upregulated.  To measure astrocyte activation after stroke, detailed histological and morphological analyses were performed in the cortical penumbra after stroke using unbiased stereology.  Consistent with other reports, we observed a marked and persistent increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP ) as soon as 3 hours after MCAO.  In contrast, vimentin immunoreactivity appeared 12-24 hours after stroke, peaked at 72 hours, and returned to baseline after 30 days.  Surprisingly, no change in overall astrocyte number was observed based on glutamine synthetase (GS) immunoreactivity.  To determine if Hsp72Tg mice exhibited altered astrocyte activation compared to WT controls, morphological evaluation by fractal analysis was used.  Overexpression of Hsp72 reduced astrocyte cell area, arbor area, and to a lesser extent fractal dimension, 72 hours following stroke.  In conclusion, in vivo overexpression of Hsp72 alters gene expression following stroke, including genes involved in astrocyte activation, and decreases astrocyte activation acutely following MCAO.  Thus, modulation of astrogliosis may be a neuroprotective mechanism exerted by Hsp72 after ischemia. A total of 10 samples were analyzed, with 5 of each genotype, wildtype (WT) and Hsp72-overexpressing (Hsp72Tg) mice.  Of the 5 in each group, 3 received middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 2 received a sham surgery.  The sham samples serve as the controls for the MCAO samples in each genotype.

Analysis of the gene expression in the brain is a valuable tool to study the function of the brain under normal and pathological conditions. Gene microarray technology allows massively parallel analysis of most genes expressed in a tissue, and therefore is an important research tool that potentially can provide the investigative power needed to address the complexity of brain aging and neurodegenerative processes. One of the reasons that account for the resistance of AD pathogenesis to analysis is that clinically normal subjects may exhibit considerable AD pathology, blurring criteria for distinguishing subjects with normal aging or AD. Here, we analyzed hippocampal and cortex frontal gene expression from 32 subjects separated in individuals presenting, 1) both pathologic and clinical AD (definitive AD); 2) AD pathology and normal clinic (pathologic AD); 3) cognitive impairment, without AD pathology (others dementias); and 4) no cognitive impairment, without AD pathology (normal individuals).

The GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exhibit changes in the expression of genes encoding receptors for glutamate and in the signaling pathways triggered by dopamine binding to G-protein-coupled dopamine receptors. Deep sequence analysis provides a sensitive, quantitative and global analysis of the effects of Cocaine on the NAc transcriptome. RNA prepared from the NAc of adult male mice receiving daily injections of Saline or Cocaine, or Cocaine followed by a period of Withdrawal, was used for high-throughput sequence analysis. Changes were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. On the basis of pathway analysis, a preponderance of the genes affected by Cocaine and Withdrawal was involved in the cadherin, heterotrimeric G-protein and Wnt signaling pathways. Distinct subsets of cadherins and protocadherins exhibited a sustained increase or decrease in expression. Sustained down-regulation of several heterotrimeric G-protein ?- and ?-subunits was observed. In addition to altered expression of receptors for small molecule neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and endocannabinoids, changes in the expression of plasma membrane transporters and vesicular neurotransmitter transporters were also observed. The effects of chronic Cocaine and Withdrawal on the expression of genes essential to cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, peptidergic and endocannabinoid signaling are as profound as their effects on dopaminergic transmission.

Using panels of congenic mice, we resolved the Bmgr5 QTL into two separate subloci, termed Bmgr5a and Bmgr5b, each conferring permissiveness for the engraftment phenotype and both fine mapped to an interval amenable to positional cloning.  Candidate Bmgr5 genes were then prioritized using whole exome DNA sequencing and microarray gene expression profiling.  Further studies are needed to elucidate the genetic interaction between Bmgr5a and Bmgr5b and identify causative genes and underlying gene variants.  This may lead to new approaches for overcoming the problem of graft rejection in clinical hematopoietic cell transplantation. B10.BALBChr16 and BALB.B10Chr16 consomic strain mice were constructed in our laboratory for validation of bone marrow engraftment and graft-vs-host diseaes QTLs.  The parental strains for consomic line construction were B10.BR (B10.BR-H2k H2-T18a/SgSnJJrep) and BALB.K (C.C3-H2k/LilMcdJ).

Nevertheless the biological influence of Gromwell extract on general physiology of eukaryotic cells remains unknown. In this study, we for the first time performed a global transcriptome analysis by using DNA microarray analysis to identify genes affected by the addition of Gromwell extract (GE) by using a eukaryotic microorganism, basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, as a model system. RESULTS: The transcriptome analysis revealed that a total of 1932 genes are differentially regulated in a statistically significant manner and expressions of 715 genes are up- (315 genes) or down-regulated (457 genes) more than twofold upon GE treatment. In response to GE treatment, genes involved in signal transduction genes are immediately regulated and the evolutionarily conserved set of genes involved in the core cellular functions, including DNA replication, RNA transcription/processing, and protein translation/processing, are generally upregulated. In contrast, a number of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, post-translational modification/protein turnover/chaperone functions, and signal transduction are downregulated by the GE treatment. Among the GE-responsive genes that are also evolutionarily conserved in the human genome, we confirmed expression patterns of YSA1, TPO2, FET5 (CFO1), and PZF1 by Northern blot analysis. Based on the functional characterization of some GE-responsive genes through phenotypic analysis of gene knockout mutants, we found that GE treatment may promote cellular tolerance against a variety of environmental stresses in eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: A significant portion of the Cryptococcus genome is affected in expression levels by treatment of GE, implying that the general physiology of eukaryotic cells is significantly affected by the GE treatment. There are more than 95% of genome homology between JEC21 and H99. Therefore 6 slides of JEC21 (Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans serotype D) 70-mer oligo are used in this analysis, 3 biological replicate experiments are performed, total RNAs are extracted from H99 (H99 Wild type strain (Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii serotype A)) with 6.4 mg/ml Gromwell extract in 0, 10, 30, 60 min.

We searched for genes that have the potential to distinguish healthy BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers from non-carriers based on differences in expression profiling. Using expression microarrays we compared gene expression of irradiated lymphocytes from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers versus control non-carriers. We identified 137 probe sets in BRCA1 carriers and 1345 in BRCA2 carriers with differential gene expression. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that most of these genes relate to regulation pathways of DNA repair processes, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Real-time PCR was performed on the 36 genes which were most prominently differentially expressed in the microarray assay; 21 genes were shown to be significantly differentially expressed in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers  as compared to controls (p<0.05).

Class 1 phosphatidylinositol 3'' kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in cell proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. Here we investigate biomarker strategies for PI3K pathway inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).   Molecular profiling of NSCLC tumor samples showed that copy number gains in PIK3CA and total loss of PTEN protein were common in squamous cell carcinoma samples, whereas LKB1 loss and mutations in KRAS and EGFR were common in adenocarcinomas. A panel of NSCLC cell lines characterized for alterations in the PI3K pathway was screened with PI3K and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to assess the preclinical predictive value of candidate biomarkers.   Cell lines harboring pathway alterations (RTK activation, PI3K mutation or amplification, PTEN loss) were exquisitely sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. A dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor had broader activity across the cell line panel and in tumor xenografts. The combination of GDC-0941 with paclitaxel, erlotinib, or a MEK inhibitor had greater effects on cell viability than PI3K inhibition alone.

Cancer cells rely on Hsp90 to chaperone activated oncoproteins, and its involvement in numerous signaling pathways makes it an attractive target for drug development. Surprisingly, however, the impact of Hsp90 inhibitors on cancer cells is most commonly cytostatic, and efforts to enhance the anti-tumor activity of Hsp90 inhibitors in the clinic remain a significant challenge. In this study, we show that dual inhibition of Wee1 tyrosine kinase and Hsp90 causes prostate cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Gene-expression profiling revealed that induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by this drug combination coincided with transcriptional down-regulation of Survivin and Wee1, an outcome not seen in cells treated separately with either agent. At the translational level, expression of these two proteins as well as activated Akt was completely abrogated. Similar results were obtained in prostate cancer xenografts. These data establish a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in prostate cancer, and they provide a mechanistic rationale for stimulating the pro-apoptotic activity of Hsp90 inhibitors.

Using mRNA-Seq we have characterized specific and general responses of the root challenged with these endoparastic root nematodes with very different modes of action. Root knot nematodes induce major developmental reprogramming of the root tip, where they force the cortical cells to form multinucleate giant cells, resulting in gall-development. Our results show that root knot nematodes force the plant to produce and transfer nutrients, like sugars and amino acids, to this tissue. Migratory nematodes, on the other hand, induce the expression of proteins involved in plant death and oxidative stress, and obstruct the normal metabolic activity of the root. While migratory nematode infection also causes upregulation of biotic stress-related genes early in the infection, the root knot nematodes seem to actively suppress the local defence  of the plant root. This is exemplified by a downregulation of genes involved in the salicylic acid and ethylene pathways. Interestingly, hormone pathways usually involved in plant development, were strongly induced (auxin and gibberellin) or repressed (cytokinin) in the galls. In addition, thousands of novel transcriptionally active regions as well as highly expressed nematode transcripts were detected in the infected root tissues.

We show that the brains of young adult mice treated with a single systemic dose of MAM display DNA damage (O6-methylguanine lesions) that peaks at 48 hours and decline to near-normal levels at 7 days post-treatment.  By contrast, at this time, MAM-treated mice lacking the gene encoding the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), showed persistent O6-methylguanine DNA damage. The DNA damage was linked to cell-signaling pathways that are perturbed in cancer and neurodegenerative disease.  These data are consistent with the established carcinogenic and developmental neurotoxic properties of MAM in rodents, and they support the proposal that cancer and neurodegeneration share common signal transduction pathways. They also strengthen the hypothesis that early life exposure to the MAM glucoside cycasin has an etiological association with a declining, prototypical neurodegenerative disease seen in Guam, Japan, and New Guinea populations that formerly used the neurotoxic cycad plant for medicine and/or food.

MLL-AF9 transduced single HSC or GMP could be continuously replated, but HSC-derived clones were more likely than GMP-derived clones to initiate AML in mice. Leukemia stem cells derived from either HSC or GMP had a similar immunophenotype consistent with a maturing myeloid cell (LGMP).

The gene expression signature of LGMP derived from HSC was enriched in poor prognosis human MLL-rearranged AML in three independent data sets. Moreover, global 5-mC levels were elevated in HSC-derived leukemias as compared to GMP-derived leukemias. This mirrored a difference seen in 5-mC between MLL-rearranged human leukemias that are either EVI1-positive or EVI1-negative.

Although the molecular biology of PDAC begins to be revealed, genes or pathways that specifically drive tumour progression or metastasis are not well understood. Therefore, we performed microarray analyses on whole-tumour samples of 2 human PDAC subpopulations with similar clinicopathological features, but extremely distinct survival rates after potentially curative surgery, i.e., good outcome (OS and DFS?>?50?months) versus bad outcome (OS?<?19?months and DFS?<?7?months). Additionally, liver- and peritoneal metastases were analysed and compared to primary cancer tissue. The integrin and ephrin receptor families were upregulated in all PDAC samples, irrespective of outcome, supporting an important role of the interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and the surrounding desmoplastic reaction in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Moreover, some components, such as ITGB1 and EPHA2, were upregulated in PDAC samples with a poor outcome, Additionally, overexpression of the non-canonical Wnt/?-catenin pathway and EMT genes in PDAC samples with bad versus good outcome suggests their contribution to the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer, with ?-catenin being also highly upregulated in metastatic tissue. Thus, we conclude that components of the integrin and ephrin pathways and EMT-related genes might serve as molecular markers in pancreatic cancer as their expression seems to be related with prognosis.

In Type1 both cell subsets displayed an undifferentiated phenotype.  In the Type2 AML the RC showed a very similar undifferentiated progenitor-like phenotype as in Type1 RC, whereas the NRC exhibited a more differentiated hematopoietic phenotype. The frequency of RC per sample was a determinant of whether a patient belonged to Type1 or Type2. Type2 RC had higher expression of CD321, higher colony formation capacity and greater responsiveness to cytokines secreted by NRC. Further analysis of clinical mRNA databases revealed that CD321 was a prognostic indicator for AML and a potential marker of clonogenic activity associated with this AML cancer lineage.

This ubiquitination facilitates methylation of histone H3 at K4 and K79, and accounts for the roles of Bre1 and its homologs in transcriptional regulation. Recent studies by others suggested that Bre1 acts as a tumor suppressor, augmenting expression of select tumor suppressor genes and suppressing select oncogenes. In this study we present an additional mechanism of tumor suppression by Bre1 through maintenance of genomic stability.  We track the evolution of genomic instability in Bre1-deficient cells from replication-associated double-strand breaks (DSBs) to specific genomic rearrangements that explain a rapid increase in DNA content and trigger breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. We show that aberrant RNA-DNA structures (R-loops) constitute a significant source of DSBs in Bre1-deficient cells. Combined with a previously reported defect in homologous recombination, generation of R-loops is a likely initiator of replication stress and genomic instability in Bre1-deficient cells. We propose that genomic instability triggered by Bre1 deficiency may be an important early step that precedes acquisition of an invasive phenotype, as we find decreased levels of BRE1A/B and dimethylated H3K79 in testicular seminoma and in the premalignant lesion in situ carcinoma.

To understand the immediate and adaptive response of primary murine hematopoietic cells to the transcriptional upregulation of Evi1, we developed an inducible lentiviral vector system with a robust expression switch. We found that Evi1 delays differentiation and promotes survival in myeloid culture conditions, orchestrating a battery of genes involved in stemness (Aldh1a1, Ly6a [Sca1], Abca1, Epcam, among others). Importantly, Evi1 suppresses Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), while it upregulates Cdk inhibitors, inducing quiescence in various proliferation-inducing cytokine conditions and operating in a strictly dose-dependent manner. Hematopoietic cells with persisting Evi1-induction tend to adopt a relatively low expression level. We thus classify Evi1 as a dormancy-inducing oncogene, likely requiring epigenetic and genetic compensation for cell expansion and malignant progression.

This lesion is characterized by intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, and microvilli destruction. The genes responsible to cause that lesion are located in a pathogenicity island called Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE). Transcription of LEE genes is subjected to various levels of regulation, including quorum sensing through autoinducer 3 (AI-3) system. AI-3 is an aromatic compound with similar characteristics to the epinephrine and norepinephrine hormones. This similarity allows bacteria to use these hormones and AI-3 to perform cell  to  cell signaling processes and bacteria - host communication processes in order to modulate its virulence. AI-3, epinephrine and norepinephrine are detected by a sensor kinase named quorum sensing E.coli regulator (QseC). In order to investigate the role of QseC and epinephrine in atypical EPEC O55:H7 virulence, we constructed a QseC mutant of this strain and performed transcription and phenotypic analyses in the presence or absence of epinephrine. We have reported here, for the first time, the quorum sensing QseC regulation of virulence genes in atypical EPEC.

The resulting tyrosine to asparagine amino acid change in TgRRM1 causes severe temperature instability that generates an effective null phenotype for this protein when the mutant is shifted to the restrictive temperature.  Orthologs of TgRRM1 are widely conserved in diverse eukaryote lineages, and the human counterpart (RBM42) can functionally replace the missing Toxoplasma factor. The interaction of TgRRM1 with factors of the tri-SNP complex (U4/U6 & U5 snRNPs) indicate this factor may be required to assemble an active spliceosome.  Thus, the TgRRM1 family of proteins is an unrecognized and evolutionarily conserved class of splicing regulators. We describe transcriptome of the temperature sensitive mutant 12-109C6.

We defined TBI doses that lead to graft rejection, that are permissive for engraftment, and mouse strain variation with regards to the permissive TBI dose.  We now report gene expression analysis, using the Agilent Mouse 8x60K v3 expression arrays, in spleen of mice conditioned with TBI doses for evaluation in correlation to the expected engraftment phenotype.  The spleens of mice given TBI demonstrated extensive differential gene expression, compared with un-irradiated controls, at both multiple testing-corrected P < .05 and fold change greater than or equal to  2 levels. Functional analysis revealed significant enrichment for up-regulation of canonical pathways involved in inflammation, even when treated with TBI doses not permissive for engraftment.  Consistent with this the most significantly associated upstream regulators included lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor, and a toll-like receptor.  Unique to engrafting mice, however, were enrichment for a down-regulated canonical pathway related to B-cell development.

To analyze the genes functioning downstream of Lmx1a, we performed expression microarray analysis of LMX1A overexpressing MN9D dopaminergic cells. Several interesting regulated genes were identified, based on their regulation in other, previously generated expression arrays, and their expression pattern in the developing mdDA neuronal field. Post analysis through in vivo expression analysis in Lmx1a mouse mutant (drJ/drJ) embryos demonstrated a clear decrease in expression of the genes Grb10 and Rgs4, in and adjacent to the rostral and dorsal mdDA neuronal field and within the Lmx1a expression domain.

We found that Evi1 delays differentiation and promotes survival in myeloid culture conditions, orchestrating a battery of genes involved in stemness (Aldh1a1, Ly6a [Sca1], Abca1, Epcam, among others). Importantly, Evi1 suppresses Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), while it upregulates Cdk inhibitors, inducing quiescence in various proliferation-inducing cytokine conditions and operating in a strictly dose-dependent manner.

We hypothesized that miRNAs might be involved in the progression of CKD.  In our previous studies we found chronic renal damages developed progressively in rats with 5/6 nephrectomy.  L-mimosine(L-Mim) intervention from wk 5 to wk 12 improved renal function and resulted in additional accumulation of HIF-1 ? and -2 ? at wk 12.  In the current study we found miR-29c was up-regulated in the L-Mim treated group compared with the control using Agilent miRNA microarrays.  Of the microRNAs and proteins that exhibited reciprocal changes in expression following the L-Mim treatment, miR-29c and tropomyosin 1? (TPM1), which is involved in stress fiber function, met the sequence criteria for microRNA-target interaction,  were later confirmed by 3''-untranslated region reporter analysis.  TGF?1 treatment (3 ng/ml, 24 hours) decreased miR-29c expression and up-regulated protein expression of TPM1 in human renal epithelial cells. Overexpression of miR-29c significantly attenuated TGF-?1 induced increase in TPM1 in vitro. Moreover,  intrarenal expression of miR-29c was decreased in IgAN patients with moderate to severe tubulointerstital fibrosis (TIF), compared with IgAN patients without TIF, and intrarenal protein expression of TMP1 was significantly increased in IgAN patients with TIF.  The results suggest that intrarenal expression of miR-29c was down-regulated while its predicted target, TPM1 was up-regulated in the progression of CKD.  Short term stabilizing of HIF up-regulates miR-29c and attenuates CKD in the remnant kidney model. Four weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy, rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or L-mimosine (L-Mim, Calbiochem), a prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitor (PHD), at a dosage of 50 mg/kg every other day.  At the end of wk 12 after 5/6 nephrectomy, all rats (n=4, for each group) were sacrificed and blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture.

The degree of manipulation of host gene expression is dependent on host-virus specificity and certain abiotic factors. In order to gain insight into global transcriptomic changes for a geminivirus pathosystem, South African cassava mosaic virus [ZA:99] (SACMV-ZA:99]) and Arabidopsis thaliana, 4 x 44K Agilent microarrays were adopted. After normalization, a 2-fold change filtering of data (p<0.05) identified 1,820 differentially expressed genes in apical leaf tissue. A significant increase in differential gene expression over time (451 genes at 14 dpi, 742 genes at 24 dpi, and 1011 genes at 36 dpi) was observed. This increase in expression, correlated with an increase in SACMV accumulation as virus copies were 5-fold higher at 24 dpi and 6-fold higher at 36 dpi than at 14 dpi (1.1x104 virus copies present at 14 dpi, 5.7x104 copies at 24 dpi, and 6.3x104 copies at 36 dpi). Many 2-fold genes were primarily involved in stress and defense responses, phytohormone signalling pathways, cellular transport, cell-cycle regulation, transcription, oxidation-reduction, and other metabolic processes. Forty-one genes (2.3%) were shown to be continuously expressed across the infection period, indicating that the majority of genes were transient and unique to a particular time point. Plant signalling networks were disrupted and manipulated by SACMV-[ZA:99] in order to affect homeostasis and antagonize hosts defense responses. At the same time, an adaptive response was initiated to reprogramme metabolism and divert energy from growth-related processes to defense, all leading to disruption of normal biological host processes. Comparisons between SACMV-[ZA:99] with plant-infecting RNA and DNA viruses revealed similarities and differences in expression patterns among viruses, showing either general defense or virus-specific responses. Within the Geminiviridae family in particular, similarities in cell-cycle regulation and gene expression patterns correlated between SACMV-[ZA:99] and Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) but differences were also evident. For instance, CaLCuV showed antagonistic interactions between Salicyclic Acid (SA) and Jasmonic Acid (JA) pathways, whereas SACMV displayed synergism. Differences in gene induction, repression and outcome between the two geminiviruses clearly demonstrated host-specific interactions with SACMV-[ZA:99] leading to infection. To our knowledge this is the first geminivirus study identifying differentially expressed transcripts across 3 time points A three time-point (14, 24, and 36 dpi) study was carried out to identify differentially expressed genes in SACMV-[ZA:99] infected Arabidopsis leaf cells using a direct comparison design against mock-inoculated controls.

We and others have demonstrated that radiation-induced rat mammary cancer exhibits a characteristic gene expression profile and a random increase in aberrant DNA copy number; however, the role of aberrant miRNA expression is unclear. We performed a microarray analysis of frozen samples of eight mammary cancers induced by gamma-irradiation (2 Gy), eight spontaneous mammary cancers, and seven normal mammary samples. We found that a small set of miRNAs was characteristically overexpressed in radiation-induced cancer. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that miR-135b, miR-192, miR-194, and miR-211 were significantly upregulated in radiation-induced mammary cancer compared with spontaneous cancer and normal mammary tissue. The expression of miR-192 and miR-194 also was upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines compared with non-cancer cells. Manipulation of the miR-194 expression level using a synthetic inhibiting RNA produced a small but significant suppression of cell proliferation and upregulation in the expression of several genes that are suggested to act as tumor suppressors in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells.

It affects over 200 million people across 74 countries. The complete genome sequence of Schistosoma mansoni was published in 2009, but immune response against this parasite is not well characterized. We will study the overall immune response, antibody and TCR repertoire of immunologically nave mice, mice infected with S.mansoni and mice challenged with a secondary schistosome infection.We plan to use RNA-seq to characterise the systemic immune response of mouse to Schistosoma infection, including both whole-transcriptome sequencing for a global picture of the immune response, and to sequence the  lymphocyte antigen receptor genes to get a detailed picture of the adaptive immune response.  B and T lymphocytes are the most important cells in this response, as they are responsible for recognising immune targets through the specificities of their antigen receptors. Antibodies and TCR are formed by recombination among gene segments (V, D and J), sequence diversification at the junctions, and somatic hypermutation throughout the genes. Two complementary sequencing strategies will allow us to investigate these two aspects of the immune response. RNA-seq data should give novel insight into the global response, as well as acting as a control for the PCR of lymphocyte receptor genes, by allowing us to quantify and correct for any bias in the PCR. rtPCR of lymphocyte receptor mRNA (initially immunoglobulins, but later we hope to investigate the T-cell receptor also) followed by 454 sequencing should allow us to characterise the antigen receptor repertoire and its response to schistosome infection.  A number of different pools of redundant PCR primers have been described for the amplification of lymphocyte receptor genes, including one known to work in BALB/c mice (Nat. Biotech. 28:965-969). Muros laboratory in Salamanca is performing the infections and RNA extraction, and has provided phenotypic data and immunological measurements that we hope to relate to the expression data we will generate. Multiple replicates are needed to quantify the variation in immune response observed in animals with different intensity of infection. For the total RNA sequencing, samples will be multiplexed on illumina lanes. It is difficult to statistically design experiments of this kind without preliminary data on the effect size (change in expression between infected and uninfected mice), but initial inspection of RNAseq experiments of spleen in uninfected mice shows very high expression of many immune-related genes. 1/16 plate of 454 sequencing will give about 37,500 reads per sample, which will give us a 98% chance of detecting any transcript present at over 0.01% frequency in the repertoire of any sample. This is clearly a small sampling of the estimated 109 antibody-producing B cells in a mouse, and we do not expect to be able to characterise the entire repertoire, but to detect shared antibody responses between infections. The power of this approach depends on how polarised the immunoglobulin repertoire becomes in response to infection. The only published experimental evidence that seems to give us any handle on to what extent shared antibody molecules are expressed in different individuals (Nat. Biotech. 28:965-969) finds particular immunoglobulin sequences at frequencies of between 1% and 10% of the repertoire in mice immunised with a defined antigens, present in multiple mice.

The Ogt gene locus resides on the X-chromosome and its activity is required for the viability of male ES cells. Using Ogt conditional knock out (KO) ES cells it was shown the failure of establishing stable KO ES clones further suggesting that Ogt activity is required for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency. For understanding these changes, we performed global gene expression upon silencing of Ogt mediated by esiRNA in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.

The Ts65Dn mouse model of DS also exhibits muscle weakness in vivo and may serve as a useful model to examine potential factors responsible for DS-associated muscle dysfunction. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to directly assess skeletal muscle function in the Ts65Dn mouse and to reveal potential mechanisms of DS-associated muscle weakness. Soleus muscles were harvested from anesthetized male Ts65Dn and wild-type (WT) colony controls.  In vitro muscle contractile experiments revealed normal force generation of unfatigued Ts65Dn soleus, but a 12% reduction in force was observed in Ts65Dn muscle during recovery following fatiguing contractions compared to WT muscle (p<0.05). Oxidative stress may contribute to DS-related pathologies, including muscle weakness, which may be the result of overexpression of chromosome 21 genes (e.g., copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1)). SOD1 expression was 25% higher (p<0.05) in Ts65Dn soleus compared to WT muscle but levels of other antioxidant proteins were unchanged. Lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynoneal) was unaltered in Ts65Dn muscle although protein carbonyls were 20% greater compared to muscle of WT animals (p<0.05). Cytochrome c oxidase expression was reduced 22% in Ts65Dn muscle, suggesting a limitation in mitochondrial function may contribute to post-fatigue muscle weakness. Microarray analysis of Ts65Dn soleus revealed alteration of numerous cellular pathways including: proteolysis, glucose and fat metabolism, neuromuscular transmission, and ATP biosynthesis. In summary, the Ts65Dn mouse displays evidence of muscle dysfunction, and the potential role of mitochondria and oxidative stress warrants further investigation. We used microarrays to gain insight into potential mechanisms of DS-associated skeletal muscle weakness. Soleus muscles were obtained from four male Ts65Dn (DS) mice and four male colony control mice. Animals were apparently healthy and approximately five months old. The muscles were harvested in the basal state under anesthesia induced by sodium pentobarbital at approximately the same time of the day.', '1132/NCBITaxon:10090', '1136/efo:EFO_0002768'

Here we report that vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling attenuates Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammation by enhancing the negative feedback inhibition. VDR inactivation leads to a hyperinflammatory response in mice and macrophage cultures when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) due to miR-155 overproduction that excessively suppresses SOCS1, a key regulator that enhances the negative feedback loop. Deletion of miR-155 attenuates vitamin D suppression of LPS-induced inflammation, confirming that 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates SOCS1 by down-regulating miR-155. 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates bic transcription by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation, which is mediated by a kappaB cis-DNA element located within the first intron of the bic gene.

The promising role of MSCs in cell-based therapies and tissue engineering appears to be limited due to a decline of their regenerative potential with increasing donor age, their limited availability in human tissues and the need of in vitro expansion prior to treatment. We therefore aimed to determine to which degree in vitro aging and chronological aging may be similar processes or if in vitro culture-related changes at the cellular and molecular level are at least altered as a function of donor age. For that purpose we established MSCs cultures from young (yMSCs) and aged (aMSCs) rats that were cultured for more than 100 passages. These long-term MSCs cultures were non-tumorigenic and exhibited similar surface marker patterns as primary MSCs of passage 2. During in vitro expansion, but not during chronological aging, MSCs progressively lose their progenitor characteristics, e.g., complete loss of osteogenic differentiation potential, diminished adipogenic differentiation, altered cell morphology and increased susceptibility towards senescence. Transcriptome analysis revealed that long-term in vitro MSCs cultivation leads to down-regulation of genes involved in cell differentiation, focal adhesion organization, cytoskeleton turnover and mitochondria function. Accordingly, functional analysis demonstrated altered mitochondrial morphology, decreased antioxidant capacities and elevated ROS levels in long-term cultivated yMSCs as well as aMSCs. Notably, only the MSC migration potential and their antioxidative capacity were altered by in vitro as well as chronological aging. Based on specific differences observed between the impact of chronological and in vitro MSC aging we conclude that both are distinct processes.

Immunohistochemistry confirmed high MCL1 protein expression predominantly in ABC DLBCL in an independent patient cohort (n=249; p=0.001).

In this study, we attempted to determine whether global gene expression differences can be detected in different genetic groups of Atlantic salmon as a result of Piscirickettsia salmonis infection. Moreover, we sought to characterize the fish transcriptional response in order to reveal the mechanisms that might confer resistance in Atlantic salmon to an infection with Piscirickettsia salmonis. In doing so, after challenging with Piscirickettsia salmonis, we selected the families with the highest (HS) and the lowest (LS) recorded susceptibility for gene expression analysis using 32K cGRASP microarrays. Our results revealed in LS families expression changes are linked to iron depletion, as well as, low contents of iron in kidney cells and low bacterial load, indicated that the iron-withholding strategy of innate immunity is part of the mechanism of resistance against Piscirickettsia salmonis. This information contributes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of resistance to Piscirickettsia salmonis infection in Atlantic salmon and to identify new candidate genes for selective breeding programmes.
